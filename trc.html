<p>For over a century, the central goals of Canada’s Aboriginal policy were to eliminate Aboriginal governments; ignore Aboriginal rights; terminate the Treaties; and, through a process of assimilation, cause Aboriginal peoples to cease to exist as distinct legal, social, cultural, religious, and racial entities in Canada.<!-- page 007 -->
The establishment and operation of residential schools were a central element of this policy, which can best be described as “cultural genocide.”<!-- page 007 --></p>
<p><em>Physical genocide</em> is the mass killing of the members of a targeted group, and <em>biological genocide</em> is the destruction of the group’s reproductive capacity.<!-- page 007 -->
<em>Cultural genocide</em> is the destruction of those structures and practices that allow the group to continue as a group.<!-- page 007 -->
States that engage in cultural genocide set out to destroy the political and social institutions of the targeted group.<!-- page 007 -->
Land is seized, and populations are forcibly transferred and their movement is restricted.<!-- page 007 -->
Languages are banned.<!-- page 007 -->
Spiritual leaders are persecuted, spiritual practices are forbidden, and objects of spiritual value are confiscated and destroyed.<!-- page 007 -->
And, most significantly to the issue at hand, families are disrupted to prevent the transmission of cultural values and identity from one generation to the next.<!-- page 007 --></p>
<p>In its dealing with Aboriginal people, Canada did all these things.<!-- page 007 --></p>
<p>Canada asserted control over Aboriginal land.<!-- page 007 -->
In some locations, Canada negotiated Treaties with First Nations; in others, the land was simply occupied or seized.<!-- page 007 -->
The negotiation of Treaties, while seemingly honourable and legal, was often marked by fraud and coercion, and Canada was, and remains, slow to implement their provisions and intent.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^1</a><!-- page 007 -->
On occasion, Canada forced First Nations to relocate their reserves from agriculturally valuable or resource-rich land onto remote and economically marginal reserves.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^2</a><!-- page 007 -->
Without legal authority or foundation, in the 1880s Canada instituted a “pass system” that was intended to confine First Nations people to their reserves.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^3</a><!-- page 007 -->
Canada replaced existing forms of Aboriginal government with relatively powerless band councils whose decisions it could override and whose leaders it could depose.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^4</a><!-- page 007 -->
In the process, it disempowered Aboriginal women, who had held significant influence and powerful roles in many First Nations, including the Mohawks, the Carrier, and Tlingit.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^5</a><!-- page 007 --></p>
<p><img alt="Alert Bay, British Columbia, school, 1885. The federal government has estimated that over 150,000 students attended Canada’s residential schools. Library and Archives Canada, George Dawson, PA-037934." src="image-autofix/page-008.jpg" /><!-- page 008 --></p>
<p>Canada denied the right to participate fully in Canadian political, economic, and social life to those Aboriginal people who refused to abandon their Aboriginal identity.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^6</a><!-- page 008 --></p>
<p>Canada outlawed Aboriginal spiritual practices, jailed Aboriginal spiritual leaders, and confiscated sacred objects.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^7</a><!-- page 008 --></p>
<p>And, Canada separated children from their parents, sending them to residential schools.<!-- page 008 -->
This was done not to educate them, but primarily to break their link to their culture and identity.<!-- page 008 -->
In justifying the government’s residential school policy, Canada’s first prime minister, Sir John A.<!-- page 008 -->
Macdonald, told the House of Commons in 1883:<!-- page 008 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>When the school is on the reserve the child lives with its parents, who are savages; he is surrounded by savages, and though he may learn to read and write his habits, and training and mode of thought are Indian.<!-- page 008 -->
He is simply a savage who can read and write.<!-- page 008 -->
It has been strongly pressed on myself, as the head of the Department, that Indian children should be withdrawn as much as possible from the parental influence, and the only way to do that would be to put them in central training industrial schools where they will acquire the habits and modes of thought of white men.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^8</a><!-- page 008 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>These measures were part of a coherent policy to eliminate Aboriginal people as distinct peoples and to assimilate them into the Canadian mainstream against their will.<!-- page 008 -->
Deputy Minister of Indian Affairs Duncan Campbell Scott outlined the goals of that policy in 1920, when he told a parliamentary committee that “our object is to continue until there is not a single Indian in Canada that has not been absorbed into the body politic.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^9</a><!-- page 008 --><!-- page 009 -->
These goals were reiterated in 1969 in the federal government’s <em>Statement on Indian Policy</em> (more often referred to as the “White Paper”), which sought to end Indian status and terminate the Treaties that the federal government had negotiated with First Nations.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^10</a><!-- page 009 --></p>
<p>The Canadian government pursued this policy of cultural genocide because it wished to divest itself of its legal and financial obligations to Aboriginal people and gain control over their land and resources.<!-- page 009 -->
If every Aboriginal person had been “absorbed into the body politic,” there would be no reserves, no Treaties, and no Aboriginal rights.<!-- page 009 --></p>
<p>Residential schooling quickly became a central element in the federal government’s Aboriginal policy.<!-- page 009 -->
When Canada was created as a country in 1867, Canadian churches were already operating a small number of boarding schools for Aboriginal people.<!-- page 009 -->
As settlement moved westward in the 1870s, Roman Catholic and Protestant missionaries established missions and small boarding schools across the Prairies, in the North, and in British Columbia.<!-- page 009 -->
Most of these schools received small, per-student grants from the federal government.<!-- page 009 -->
In 1883, the federal government moved to establish three, large, residential schools for First Nation children in western Canada.<!-- page 009 -->
In the following years, the system grew dramatically.<!-- page 009 -->
According to the Indian Affairs annual report for 1930, there were eighty residential schools in operation across the country.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^11</a><!-- page 009 -->
The Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement provided compensation to students who attended 139 residential schools and residences.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^12</a><!-- page 009 -->
The federal government has estimated that at least 150,000 First Nation, Métis, and Inuit students passed through the system.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^13</a><!-- page 009 --></p>
<p>Roman Catholic, Anglican, United, Methodist, and Presbyterian churches were the major denominations involved in the administration of the residential school system.<!-- page 009 -->
The government’s partnership with the churches remained in place until 1969, and, although most of the schools had closed by the 1980s, the last federally supported residential schools remained in operation until the late 1990s.<!-- page 009 --></p>
<p>For children, life in these schools was lonely and alien.<!-- page 009 -->
Buildings were poorly located, poorly built, and poorly maintained.<!-- page 009 -->
The staff was limited in numbers, often poorly trained, and not adequately supervised.<!-- page 009 -->
Many schools were poorly heated and poorly ventilated, and the diet was meagre and of poor quality.<!-- page 009 -->
Discipline was harsh, and daily life was highly regimented.<!-- page 009 -->
Aboriginal languages and cultures were denigrated and suppressed.<!-- page 009 -->
The educational goals of the schools were limited and confused, and usually reflected a low regard for the intellectual capabilities of Aboriginal people.<!-- page 009 -->
For the students, education and technical training too often gave way to the drudgery of doing the chores necessary to make the schools self-sustaining.<!-- page 009 -->
Child neglect was institutionalized, and the lack of supervision created situations where students were prey to sexual and physical abusers.<!-- page 009 --></p>
<p>In establishing residential schools, the Canadian government essentially declared Aboriginal people to be unfit parents.<!-- page 009 -->
Aboriginal parents were labelled as being indifferent to the future of their children—a judgment contradicted by the fact that parents often kept their children out of schools because they saw those schools, quite accurately, as dangerous and harsh institutions that sought to raise their children in alien ways.<!-- page 009 --><!-- page 010 -->
Once in the schools, brothers and sisters were kept apart, and the government and churches even arranged marriages for students after they finished their education.<!-- page 010 --></p>
<p><img alt="The Mission, British Columbia, school opened in the early 1860s and remained in operation until 1984. Mission Community Archives." src="image-autofix/page-010.jpg" /><!-- page 010 --></p>
<p>The residential school system was based on an assumption that European civilization and Christian religions were superior to Aboriginal culture, which was seen as being savage and brutal.<!-- page 010 -->
Government officials also were insistent that children be discouraged—and often prohibited—from speaking their own languages.<!-- page 010 -->
The missionaries who ran the schools played prominent roles in the church-led campaigns to ban Aboriginal spiritual practices such as the Potlatch and the Sun Dance (more properly called the “Thirst Dance”), and to end traditional Aboriginal marriage practices.<!-- page 010 -->
Although, in most of their official pronouncements, government and church officials took the position that Aboriginal people could be civilized, it is clear that many believed that Aboriginal culture was inherently inferior.<!-- page 010 --></p>
<p>This hostility to Aboriginal cultural and spiritual practice continued well into the twentieth century.<!-- page 010 -->
In 1942, John House, the principal of the Anglican school in Gleichen, Alberta, became involved in a campaign to have two Blackfoot chiefs deposed, in part because of their support for traditional dance ceremonies.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^14</a><!-- page 010 -->
In 1947, Roman Catholic official J. O. Plourde told a federal parliamentary committee that since Canada was a Christian nation that was committed to having “all its citizens belonging to one or other of the Christian churches,” he could see no reason why the residential schools “should foster aboriginal beliefs.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^15</a><!-- page 010 --><!-- page 011 -->
United Church official George Dorey told the same committee that he questioned whether there was such a thing as “native religion.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^16</a><!-- page 011 --></p>
<p><img alt="The goal of residential schooling was to separate children from their families, culture, and identity. Saskatchewan Archives Board, R-A2690." src="image-autofix/page-011.jpg" /><!-- page 011 --></p>
<p>Into the 1950s and 1960s, the prime mission of residential schools was the cultural transformation of Aboriginal children.<!-- page 011 -->
In 1953, J. E. Andrews, the principal of the Presbyterian school in Kenora, Ontario, wrote that “we must face realistically the fact that the only hope for the Canadian Indian is eventual assimilation into the white race.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^17</a><!-- page 011 -->
In 1957, the principal of the Gordon’s Reserve school in Saskatchewan, Albert Southard, wrote that he believed that the goal of residential schooling was to “change the philosophy of the Indian child.<!-- page 011 -->
In other words since they must work and live with ‘whites’ then they must begin to think as ‘whites.’” Southard said that the Gordon’s school could never have a student council, since “in so far as the Indian understands the department’s policy, he is against it.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^18</a><!-- page 011 -->
In a 1958 article on residential schools, senior Oblate Andre Renaud echoed the words of John A.<!-- page 011 -->
Macdonald, arguing that when students at day schools went back to their “homes at the end of the school day and for the weekend, the pupils are re-exposed to their native culture, however diluted, from which the school is trying to separate them.”<!-- page 011 -->
A residential school, on the other hand, could “surround its pupils almost twenty-four hours a day with non-Indian Canadian culture through radio, television, public address system, movies, books, newspapers, group activities, etc.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^19</a><!-- page 011 --><!-- page 012 --></p>
<p>Despite the coercive measures that the government adopted, it failed to achieve its policy goals.<!-- page 012 -->
Although Aboriginal peoples and cultures have been badly damaged, they continue to exist.<!-- page 012 -->
Aboriginal people have refused to surrender their identity.<!-- page 012 -->
It was the former students, the Survivors of Canada’s residential schools, who placed the residential school issue on the public agenda.<!-- page 012 -->
Their efforts led to the negotiation of the Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement that mandated the establishment of a residential school Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada (TRC).<!-- page 012 --></p>
<p>The Survivors acted with courage and determination.<!-- page 012 -->
We should do no less.<!-- page 012 -->
It is time to commit to a process of reconciliation.<!-- page 012 -->
By establishing a new and respectful relationship, we restore what must be restored, repair what must be repaired, and return what must be returned.<!-- page 012 --></p>
<section class="section2" id="reconciliation-at-the-crossroads"><h2><a class="toclink" href="#reconciliation-at-the-crossroads">Reconciliation at the crossroads<!-- page 012 --></a></h2>
<p>To some people, reconciliation is the re-establishment of a conciliatory state.<!-- page 012 -->
However, this is a state that many Aboriginal people assert never has existed between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people.<!-- page 012 -->
To others, reconciliation, in the context of Indian residential schools, is similar to dealing with a situation of family violence.<!-- page 012 -->
It’s about coming to terms with events of the past in a manner that overcomes conflict and establishes a respectful and healthy relationship among people, going forward.<!-- page 012 -->
It is in the latter context that the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada has approached the question of reconciliation.<!-- page 012 --></p>
<p>To the Commission, reconciliation is about establishing and maintaining a mutually respectful relationship between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal peoples in this country.<!-- page 012 -->
In order for that to happen, there has to be awareness of the past, acknowledgement of the harm that has been inflicted, atonement for the causes, and action to change behaviour.<!-- page 012 --></p>
<p>We are not there yet.<!-- page 012 -->
The relationship between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal peoples is not a mutually respectful one.<!-- page 012 -->
But, we believe we can get there, and we believe we can maintain it.<!-- page 012 -->
Our ambition is to show how we can do that.<!-- page 012 --></p>
<p>In 1996, the <em>Report of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples</em> urged Canadians to begin a national process of reconciliation that would have set the country on a bold new path, fundamentally changing the very foundations of Canada’s relationship with Aboriginal peoples.<!-- page 012 -->
Much of what the Royal Commission had to say has been ignored by government; a majority of its recommendations were never implemented.<!-- page 012 -->
But the report and its findings opened people’s eyes and changed the conversation about the reality for Aboriginal people in this country.<!-- page 012 --></p>
<p>In 2015, as the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada wraps up its work, the country has a rare second chance to seize a lost opportunity for reconciliation.<!-- page 012 -->
We live in a twenty-first-century global world.<!-- page 012 --><!-- page 013 -->
At stake is Canada’s place as a prosperous, just, and inclusive democracy within that global world.<!-- page 013 -->
At the TRC’s first National Event in Winnipeg, Manitoba, in 2010, residential school Survivor Alma Mann Scott said,<!-- page 013 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The healing is happening—the reconciliation…<!-- page 013 -->
I feel that there’s some hope for us not just as Canadians, but for the world, because I know I’m not the only one.<!-- page 013 -->
I know that Anishinaabe people across Canada, First Nations, are not the only ones.<!-- page 013 -->
My brothers and sisters in New Zealand, Australia, Ireland—there’s different areas of the world where this type of stuff happened…<!-- page 013 -->
I don’t see it happening in a year, but we can start making changes to laws and to education systems …<!-- page 013 -->
so that we can move forward.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^20</a><!-- page 013 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="Survivors’ Sharing Circle at Truth and Reconciliation Commission Manitoba National Event, June 2010." src="image-autofix/page-013.jpg" /><!-- page 013 --></p>
<p>Reconciliation must support Aboriginal peoples as they heal from the destructive legacies of colonization that have wreaked such havoc in their lives.<!-- page 013 -->
But it must do even more.<!-- page 013 -->
Reconciliation must inspire Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal peoples to transform Canadian society so that our children and grandchildren can live together in dignity, peace, and prosperity on these lands we now share.<!-- page 013 --></p>
<p>The urgent need for reconciliation runs deep in Canada.<!-- page 013 -->
Expanding public dialogue and action on reconciliation beyond residential schools will be critical in the coming years.<!-- page 013 -->
Although some progress has been made, significant barriers to reconciliation remain.<!-- page 013 -->
The relationship between the federal government and Aboriginal peoples is deteriorating.<!-- page 013 --><!-- page 014 -->
Instead of moving towards reconciliation, there have been divisive conflicts over Aboriginal education, child welfare, and justice.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^21</a><!-- page 014 -->
The daily news has been filled with reports of controversial issues ranging from the call for a national inquiry on violence towards Aboriginal women and girls to the impact of the economic development of lands and resources on Treaties and Aboriginal title and rights.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^22</a><!-- page 014 -->
The courts continue to hear Aboriginal rights cases, and new litigation has been filed by Survivors of day schools not covered under the Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement, as well as by victims of the “Sixties Scoop,” which was a child-welfare policy that removed Aboriginal children from their homes and placed them with non-Aboriginal families.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^23</a><!-- page 014 -->
The promise of reconciliation, which seemed so imminent back in 2008 when the prime minister, on behalf of all Canadians, apologized to Survivors, has faded.<!-- page 014 --></p>
<p>Too many Canadians know little or nothing about the deep historical roots of these conflicts.<!-- page 014 -->
This lack of historical knowledge has serious consequences for First Nations, Inuit, and Métis peoples, and for Canada as a whole.<!-- page 014 -->
In government circles, it makes for poor public policy decisions.<!-- page 014 -->
In the public realm, it reinforces racist attitudes and fuels civic distrust between Aboriginal peoples and other Canadians.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^24</a><!-- page 014 -->
Too many Canadians still do not know the history of Aboriginal peoples’ contributions to Canada, or understand that by virtue of the historical and modern Treaties negotiated by our government, we are all Treaty people.<!-- page 014 -->
History plays an important role in reconciliation; to build for the future, Canadians must look to, and learn from, the past.<!-- page 014 --></p>
<p>As Commissioners, we understood from the start that although reconciliation could not be achieved during the TRC’s lifetime, the country could and must take ongoing positive and concrete steps forward.<!-- page 014 -->
While the Commission has been a catalyst for deepening our national awareness of the meaning and potential of reconciliation, it will take many heads, hands, and hearts, working together, at all levels of society to maintain momentum in the years ahead.<!-- page 014 -->
It will also take sustained political will at all levels of government and concerted material resources.<!-- page 014 --></p>
<p>The thousands of Survivors who publicly shared their residential school experiences at TRC events in every region of this country have launched a much-needed dialogue about what is necessary to heal themselves, their families, communities, and the nation.<!-- page 014 -->
Canadians have much to benefit from listening to the voices, experiences, and wisdom of Survivors, Elders, and Traditional Knowledge Keepers—and much more to learn about reconciliation.<!-- page 014 -->
Aboriginal peoples have an important contribution to make to reconciliation.<!-- page 014 -->
Their knowledge systems, oral histories, laws, and connections to the land have vitally informed the reconciliation process to date, and are essential to its ongoing progress.<!-- page 014 --></p>
<p>At a Traditional Knowledge Keepers Forum sponsored by the TRC, Anishinaabe Elder Mary Deleary spoke about the responsibility for reconciliation that both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people carry.<!-- page 014 -->
She emphasized that the work of reconciliation must continue in ways that honour the ancestors, respect the land, and rebalance relationships.<!-- page 014 -->
She said,<!-- page 014 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m so filled with belief and hope because when I hear your voices at the table, I hear and know that the responsibilities that our ancestors carried …<!-- page 015 -->
are still being carried …<!-- page 015 -->
even through all of the struggles, even through all of what has been disrupted …<!-- page 015 -->
we can still hear the voice of the land.<!-- page 015 -->
We can hear the care and love for the children.<!-- page 015 -->
We can hear about our law.<!-- page 015 -->
We can hear about our stories, our governance, our feasts, [and] our medicines…<!-- page 015 -->
We have work to do.<!-- page 015 -->
That work we are [already] doing as [Aboriginal] peoples.<!-- page 015 -->
Our relatives who have come from across the water [non-Aboriginal people], you still have work to do on your road…<!-- page 015 -->
The land is made up of the dust of our ancestors’ bones.<!-- page 015 -->
And so to reconcile with this land and everything that has happened, there is much work to be done …<!-- page 015 -->
in order to create balance.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^25</a><!-- page 015 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the Victoria Regional Event in 2012, Survivor Archie Little said,<!-- page 015 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>[For] me reconciliation is righting a wrong.<!-- page 015 -->
And how do we do that?<!-- page 015 -->
All these people in this room, a lot of non-Aboriginals, a lot of Aboriginals that probably didn’t go to residential school; we need to work together…<!-- page 015 -->
My mother had a high standing in our cultural ways.<!-- page 015 -->
We lost that.<!-- page 015 -->
It was taken away…<!-- page 015 -->
And I think it’s time for you non-Aboriginals …<!-- page 015 -->
to go to your politicians and tell them that we have to take responsibility for what happened.<!-- page 015 -->
We have to work together.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^26</a><!-- page 015 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Reverend Stan McKay of the United Church, who is also a Survivor, believes that reconciliation can happen only when everyone accepts responsibility for healing in ways that foster respect.<!-- page 015 -->
He said,<!-- page 015 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>[There must be] a change in perspective about the way in which Aboriginal peoples would be engaged with Canadian society in the quest for reconciliation…<!-- page 015 -->
[We cannot] perpetuate the paternalistic concept that only Aboriginal peoples are in need of healing…<!-- page 015 -->
The perpetrators are wounded and marked by history in ways that are different from the victims, but both groups require healing…<!-- page 015 -->
How can a conversation about reconciliation take place if all involved do not adopt an attitude of humility and respect?<!-- page 015 -->
…<!-- page 015 -->
We all have stories to tell and in order to grow in tolerance and understanding we must listen to the stories of others.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^27</a><!-- page 015 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Over the past five years, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada urged Canadians not to wait until our final report was issued before contributing to the reconciliation process.<!-- page 015 -->
We have been encouraged to see that across the country, many people have been answering that call.<!-- page 015 --></p>
<p>The youth of this country are taking up the challenge of reconciliation.<!-- page 015 -->
Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal youth who attended TRC National Events made powerful statements about why reconciliation matters to them.<!-- page 015 -->
At the Alberta National Event in Edmonton in March 2014, an Indigenous youth spoke on behalf of a national Indigenous and non-Indigenous collaboration known as the “4Rs Youth Movement.”<!-- page 015 -->
Jessica Bolduc said,<!-- page 015 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>We have re-examined our thoughts and beliefs around colonialism, and have made a commitment to unpack our own baggage, and to enter into a new relationship with each other, using this momentum, to move our country forward, in light of the 150th anniversary of the Confederation of Canada in 2017.<!-- page 016 --></p>
<p>At this point in time, we ask ourselves, “What does that anniversary mean for us, as Indigenous youth and non-Indigenous youth, and how do we arrive at that day with something we can celebrate together?”…<!-- page 016 -->
Our hope is that, one day, we will live together, as recognized nations, within a country we can all be proud of.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^28</a><!-- page 016 --></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In 2013, at the British Columbia National Event in Vancouver, where over 5,000 elementary and secondary school students attended Education Day, several non-Aboriginal youth talked about what they had learned.<!-- page 016 -->
Matthew Meneses said, “I’ll never forget this day.<!-- page 016 -->
This is the first day they ever told us about residential schools.<!-- page 016 -->
If I were to see someone who’s Aboriginal, I’d ask them if they can speak their language because I think speaking their language is a pretty cool thing.”<!-- page 016 -->
Antonio Jordao said, “It makes me sad for those kids.<!-- page 016 -->
They took them away from their homes—it was torture, it’s not fair.<!-- page 016 -->
They took them away from their homes.<!-- page 016 -->
I don’t agree with that.<!-- page 016 -->
It’s really wrong.<!-- page 016 -->
That’s one of the worst things that Canada did.”<!-- page 016 -->
Cassidy Morris said, “It’s good that we’re finally learning about what happened.”<!-- page 016 -->
Jacqulyn Byers told us, “I hope that events like this are able to bring closure to the horrible things that happened, and that a whole lot of people now recognize that the crime happened and that we need to make amends for it.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^29</a><!-- page 016 --><!-- page 017 --></p>
<p><img alt="Truth and Reconciliation Commission Traditional Knowledge Keepers Forum, June 2014. University of Manitoba, Adam Dolman." src="image-autofix/page-017.jpg" /><!-- page 017 --></p>
<p>At the same National Event, TRC Honorary Witness Patsy George paid tribute to the strength of Aboriginal women and their contributions to the reconciliation process despite the oppression and violence they have experienced.<!-- page 017 -->
She said,<!-- page 017 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Women have always been a beacon of hope for me.<!-- page 017 -->
Mothers and grandmothers in the lives of our children, and in the survival of our communities, must be recognized and supported.<!-- page 017 -->
The justified rage we all feel and share today must be turned into instruments of transformation of our hearts and our souls, clearing the ground for respect, love, honesty, humility, wisdom and truth.<!-- page 017 -->
We owe it to all those who suffered, and we owe it to the children of today and tomorrow.<!-- page 017 -->
May this day and the days ahead bring us peace and justice.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^30</a><!-- page 017 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Canadians from all walks of life spoke to us about the importance of reaching out to one another in ways that create hope for a better future.<!-- page 017 -->
Whether one is First Nations, Inuit, Métis, a descendant of European settlers, a member of a minority group that suffered historical discrimination in Canada, or a new Canadian, we all inherit both the benefits and obligations of Canada.<!-- page 017 -->
We are all Treaty people who share responsibility for taking action on reconciliation.<!-- page 017 --></p>
<p>Without truth, justice, and healing, there can be no genuine reconciliation.<!-- page 018 -->
Reconciliation is not about “closing a sad chapter of Canada’s past,” but about opening new healing pathways of reconciliation that are forged in truth and justice.<!-- page 018 -->
We are mindful that knowing the truth about what happened in residential schools in and of itself does not necessarily lead to reconciliation.<!-- page 018 -->
Yet, the importance of truth telling in its own right should not be underestimated; it restores the human dignity of victims of violence and calls governments and citizens to account.<!-- page 018 -->
Without truth, justice is not served, healing cannot happen, and there can be no genuine reconciliation between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal peoples in Canada.<!-- page 018 -->
Speaking to us at the Traditional Knowledge Keepers Forum in June of 2014, Elder Dave Courchene posed a critical question: “When you talk about truth, whose truth are you talking about?”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^31</a><!-- page 018 --></p>
<p>The Commission’s answer to Elder Courchene’s question is that by <em>truth</em>, we mean not only the truth revealed in government and church residential school documents, but also the truth of lived experiences as told to us by Survivors and others in their statements to this Commission.<!-- page 018 -->
Together, these public testimonies constitute a new oral history record, one based on Indigenous legal traditions and the practice of witnessing.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^32</a><!-- page 018 -->
As people gathered at various TRC National Events and Community Hearings, they shared the experiences of truth telling and of offering expressions of reconciliation.<!-- page 018 --></p>
<p>Over the course of its work, the Commission inducted a growing circle of TRC Honorary Witnesses.<!-- page 018 -->
Their role has been to bear official witness to the testimonies of Survivors and their families, former school staff and their descendants, government and church officials, and any others whose lives have been affected by the residential schools.<!-- page 018 -->
Beyond the work of the TRC, the Honorary Witnesses have pledged their commitment to the ongoing work of reconciliation between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal peoples.<!-- page 018 -->
We also encouraged everyone who attended TRC National Events or Community Hearings to see themselves as witnesses also, with an obligation to find ways of making reconciliation a concrete reality in their own lives, communities, schools, and workplaces.<!-- page 018 --></p>
<p>As Elder Jim Dumont explained at the Traditional Knowledge Keepers Forum in June 2014, “in Ojibwe thinking, to speak the truth is to actually speak from the heart.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^33</a><!-- page 018 -->
At the Community Hearing in Key First Nation, Saskatchewan, in 2012, Survivor Wilfred Whitehawk told us he was glad that he disclosed his abuse.<!-- page 018 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don’t regret it because it taught me something.<!-- page 018 -->
It taught me to talk about truth, about me, to be honest about who I am…<!-- page 018 -->
I am very proud of who I am today.<!-- page 018 -->
It took me a long time, but I’m there.<!-- page 018 -->
And what I have, my values and belief systems are mine and no one is going to impose theirs on me.<!-- page 018 -->
And no one today is going to take advantage of me, man or woman, the government or the RCMP, because I have a voice today.<!-- page 018 -->
I can speak for me and no one can take that away.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^34</a><!-- page 018 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Survivor and the child of Survivors Vitaline Elsie Jenner said, “I’m quite happy to be able to share my story…<!-- page 018 -->
I want the people of Canada to hear, to listen, for it is the truth…<!-- page 018 -->
I also want my grandchildren to learn, to learn from me that, yes, it did happen.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^35</a><!-- page 018 --></p>
<p>Another descendant of Survivors, Daniel Elliot, told the Commission,<!-- page 019 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think all Canadians need to stop and take a look and not look away.<!-- page 019 -->
Yeah, it’s embarrassing, yeah, it’s an ugly part of our history.<!-- page 019 -->
We don’t want to know about it.<!-- page 019 -->
What I want to see from the Commission is to rewrite the history books so that other generations will understand and not go through the same thing that we’re going through now, like it never happened.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^36</a><!-- page 019 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>President of the Métis National Council Clement Chartier spoke to the Commission about the importance of truth to justice and reconciliation.<!-- page 019 -->
At the Saskatchewan National Event, he said,<!-- page 019 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The truth is important.<!-- page 019 -->
So I’ll try to address the truth and a bit of reconciliation as well.<!-- page 019 -->
The truth is that the Métis Nation, represented by the Métis National Council, is not a party to the Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement…<!-- page 019 -->
And the truth is that the exclusion of the Métis Nation or the Métis as a people is reflected throughout this whole period not only in the Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement but in the apology made by Canada as well…<!-- page 019 --></p>
<p>We are, however, the products …<!-- page 019 -->
of the same assimilationist policy that the federal government foisted upon the Treaty Indian kids.<!-- page 019 -->
So there ought to be some solution…<!-- page 019 -->
The Métis boarding schools, residential schools, are excluded.<!-- page 019 -->
And we need to ensure that everyone was aware of that and hopefully some point down the road, you will help advocate and get, you know, the governments or whoever is responsible to accept responsibility and to move forward on a path to reconciliation, because reconciliation should be for all Aboriginal peoples and not only some Aboriginal peoples.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^37</a><!-- page 019 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the British Columbia National Event, the former lieutenant-governor of British Columbia, the Honourable Steven Point, said,<!-- page 019 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>And so many of you have said today, so many of the witnesses that came forward said, “I cannot forgive.<!-- page 019 -->
I’m not ready to forgive.”<!-- page 019 -->
And I wondered why.<!-- page 019 -->
Reconciliation is about hearing the truth, that’s for sure.<!-- page 019 -->
It’s also about acknowledging that truth.<!-- page 019 -->
Acknowledging that what you’ve said is true.<!-- page 019 -->
Accepting responsibility for your pain and putting those children back in the place they would have been, had they not been taken from their homes…<!-- page 019 --></p>
<p>What are the blockages to reconciliation?<!-- page 019 -->
The continuing poverty in our communities and the failure of our government to recognize that “Yes, we own the land.”<!-- page 019 -->
Stop the destruction of our territories and for God’s sake, stop the deaths of so many of our women on highways across this country…<!-- page 019 -->
I’m going to continue to talk about reconciliation, but just as important, I’m going to foster healing in our own people, so that our children can avoid this pain, can avoid this destruction and finally, take our rightful place in this “Our Canada.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^38</a><!-- page 019 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When former residential school staff attended public TRC events, some thought it was most important to hear directly from Survivors, even if their own perspectives and memories of the schools might differ from those of the Survivors.<!-- page 019 --><!-- page 020 -->
At a Community Hearing in Thunder Bay, Ontario, Merle Nisley, who worked at the Poplar Hill residential school in the early 1970s, said,<!-- page 020 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think it would be valuable for people who have been involved in the schools to hear stories personally.<!-- page 020 -->
And I also think it would be valuable, when it’s appropriate …<!-- page 020 -->
[for] former students who are on the healing path to …<!-- page 020 -->
hear some of our stories, or to hear some of our perspectives.<!-- page 020 -->
But I know that’s a very difficult thing to do…<!-- page 020 -->
Certainly this is not the time to try to ask all those former students to sit and listen to the rationale of the former staff because there’s just too much emotion there …<!-- page 020 -->
and there’s too little trust …<!-- page 020 -->
you can’t do things like that when there’s low levels of trust.<!-- page 020 -->
So I think really a very important thing is for former staff to hear the stories and to be courageous enough just to hear them…<!-- page 020 -->
Where wrongs were done, where abuses happened, where punishment was over the top, and wherever sexual abuse happened, somehow we need to courageously sit and talk about that, and apologize.<!-- page 020 -->
I don’t know how that will happen.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^39</a><!-- page 020 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nisley’s reflections highlight one of the difficulties the Commission faced in trying to create a space for respectful dialogue between former residential school students and staff.<!-- page 020 -->
While, in most cases, this was possible, in other instances, Survivors and their family members found it very difficult to listen to former staff, particularly if they perceived the speaker to be an apologist for the schools.<!-- page 020 --></p>
<p>At the TRC Victoria Regional Event, Brother Tom Cavanaugh, the district superior of the Oblates of Mary Immaculate for British Columbia and the Yukon, spoke about his time as a supervisor at the Christie residential school.<!-- page 020 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>What I experienced over the six years I was at Christie residential school was a staff, Native and non-Native alike, working together to provide as much as possible, a safe loving environment for the children attending Christie school.<!-- page 020 -->
Was it a perfect situation?<!-- page 020 -->
No, it wasn’t a perfect situation …<!-- page 020 -->
but again, there didn’t seem to be, at that time, any other viable alternative in providing a good education for so many children who lived in relatively small and isolated communities.<!-- page 020 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Survivors and family members who were present in the audience spoke out, saying, “Truth, tell the truth.”<!-- page 020 -->
Brother Cavanaugh replied, “If you give me a chance, I will tell you the truth.”<!-- page 020 -->
When TRC Chair Justice Murray Sinclair intervened to ask the audience to allow Brother Cavanaugh to finish his statement, he was able to do so without further interruption.<!-- page 020 -->
Visibly shaken, Cavanaugh then went on to acknowledge that children had also been abused in the schools, and he condemned such actions, expressing his sorrow and regret for this breach of trust.<!-- page 020 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I can honestly say that our men are hurting too because of the abuse scandal and the rift that this has created between First Nations and church representatives.<!-- page 020 -->
Many of our men who are still working with First Nations have attended various truth &gt; and reconciliation sessions as well as Returning to Spirit sessions, hoping to bring about healing for all concerned.<!-- page 020 --><!-- page 021 -->
The Oblates desire healing for the abused and for all touched by the past breach of trust.<!-- page 021 -->
It is our hope that together we can continue to build a better society.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^40</a><!-- page 021 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Later that same day, Ina Seitcher, who attended the Christie residential school, painted a very different picture of the school from what Brother Cavanaugh had described.<!-- page 021 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I went to Christie residential school.<!-- page 021 -->
This morning I heard a priest talking about his Christie residential school.<!-- page 021 -->
I want to tell him [about] my Christie residential school.<!-- page 021 -->
I went there for ten months.<!-- page 021 -->
Ten months that impacted my life for fifty years.<!-- page 021 -->
I am just now on my healing journey…<!-- page 021 -->
I need to do this, I need to speak out.<!-- page 021 -->
I need to speak for my mom and dad who went to residential school, for my aunts, my uncles, all that are beyond now…<!-- page 021 -->
All the pain of our people, the hurt, the anger…<!-- page 021 -->
That priest that talked about how loving that Christie residential school was—it was not.<!-- page 021 -->
That priest was most likely in his office not knowing what was going on down in the dorms or in the lunchroom…<!-- page 021 -->
There were things that happened at Christie residential school, and like I said, I’m just starting my healing journey.<!-- page 021 -->
There are doors that I don’t even want to open.<!-- page 021 -->
I don’t even want to open those doors because I don’t know what it would do to me.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^41</a><!-- page 021 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>These two, seemingly irreconcilable, truths are a stark reminder that there are no easy shortcuts to reconciliation.<!-- page 021 -->
The fact that there were few direct exchanges at TRC events between Survivors and former school staff indicates that for many, the time for reconciliation had not yet arrived.<!-- page 021 -->
Indeed, for some, it may never arrive.<!-- page 021 -->
At the Manitoba National Event in 2010, Survivor Evelyn Brockwood talked about why it is important to ensure that there is adequate time for healing to occur in the truth and reconciliation process.<!-- page 021 -->
She said,<!-- page 021 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>When this came out at the beginning, I believe it was 1990, about residential schools, people coming out with their stories, and …<!-- page 021 -->
I thought the term, the words they were using, were truth, healing and reconciliation.<!-- page 021 -->
But somehow it seems like we are going from truth telling to reconciliation, to reconcile with our white brothers and sisters.<!-- page 021 -->
My brothers and sisters, we have a lot of work to do in the middle.<!-- page 021 -->
We should really lift up the word healing…<!-- page 021 -->
Go slow, we are going too fast, too fast…<!-- page 021 -->
We have many tears to shed before we even get to the word reconciliation.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^42</a><!-- page 021 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To determine the truth and to tell the full and complete story of residential schools in this country, the TRC needed to hear from Survivors and their families, former staff, government and church officials, and all those affected by residential schools.<!-- page 021 -->
Canada’s national history in the future must be based on the truth about what happened in the residential schools.<!-- page 021 -->
One hundred years from now, our children’s children and their children must know and still remember this history, because they will inherit from us the responsibility of ensuring that it never happens again.<!-- page 021 --></p>
<section class="section3" id="what-is-reconciliation"><h3><a class="toclink" href="#what-is-reconciliation">What is reconciliation?<!-- page 022 --></a></h3>
<p>During the course of the Commission’s work, it has become clear that the concept of reconciliation means different things to different people, communities, institutions, and organizations.<!-- page 022 -->
The TRC mandate describes reconciliation as “an ongoing individual and collective process, and will require commitment from all those affected including First Nations, Inuit and Métis former Indian Residential School (IRS) students, their families, communities, religious entities, former school employees, government and the people of Canada.<!-- page 022 -->
Reconciliation may occur between any of the above groups.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^43</a><!-- page 022 --></p>
<p>The Commission defines <em>reconciliation</em> as an ongoing process of establishing and maintaining respectful relationships.<!-- page 022 -->
A critical part of this process involves repairing damaged trust by making apologies, providing individual and collective reparations, and following through with concrete actions that demonstrate real societal change.<!-- page 022 -->
Establishing respectful relationships also requires the revitalization of Indigenous law and legal traditions.<!-- page 022 -->
It is important that all Canadians understand how traditional First Nations, Inuit, and Métis approaches to resolving conflict, repairing harm, and restoring relationships can inform the reconciliation process.<!-- page 022 --></p>
<p>Traditional Knowledge Keepers and Elders have long dealt with conflicts and harms using spiritual ceremonies and peacemaking practices, and by retelling oral history stories that reveal how their ancestors restored harmony to families and communities.<!-- page 022 -->
These traditions and practices are the foundation of Indigenous law; they contain wisdom and practical guidance for moving towards reconciliation across this land.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^44</a><!-- page 022 --></p>
<p>As First Nations, Inuit, and Métis communities access and revitalize their spirituality, cultures, languages, laws, and governance systems, and as non-Aboriginal Canadians increasingly come to understand Indigenous history within Canada, and to recognize and respect Indigenous approaches to establishing and maintaining respectful relationships, Canadians can work together to forge a new covenant of reconciliation.<!-- page 022 --></p>
<p>Despite the ravages of colonialism, every Indigenous nation across the country, each with its own distinctive culture and language, has kept its legal traditions and peacemaking practices alive in its communities.<!-- page 022 -->
While Elders and Knowledge Keepers across the land have told us that there is no specific word for “reconciliation” in their own languages, there are many words, stories, and songs, as well as sacred objects such as wampum belts, peace pipes, eagle down, cedar boughs, drums, and regalia, that are used to establish relationships, repair conflicts, restore harmony, and make peace.<!-- page 022 -->
The ceremonies and protocols of Indigenous law are still remembered and practised in many Aboriginal communities.<!-- page 022 --></p>
<p>At the TRC Traditional Knowledge Keepers Forum in June 2014, TRC Survivor Committee member and Elder Barney Williams told us that<!-- page 022 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>from sea to sea, we hear words that allude to …<!-- page 022 -->
what is reconciliation?<!-- page 022 -->
What does healing or forgiveness mean?<!-- page 022 -->
And how there’s parallels to all those words that the Creator gave to all the nations…<!-- page 022 -->
When I listen and reflect on the voices of the ancestors your ancestors, I hear my ancestor alluding to the same thing with a different dialect…<!-- page 022 --><!-- page 023 -->
My understanding [of reconciliation] comes from a place and time when there was no English spoken …<!-- page 023 -->
from my grandmother who was born in the 1800s…<!-- page 023 -->
I really feel privileged to have been chosen by my grandmother to be the keeper of our knowledge…<!-- page 023 -->
What do we need to do?<!-- page 023 -->
…<!-- page 023 -->
We need to go back to ceremony and embrace ceremony as part of moving forward.<!-- page 023 -->
We need to understand the laws of our people.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^45</a><!-- page 023 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the same Forum, Elder Stephen Augustine explained the roles of silence and negotiation in Mi’kmaq law.<!-- page 023 -->
He said silence is a concept, and can be used as a consequence for a wrong action or to teach a lesson.<!-- page 023 -->
Silence is employed according to proper procedures, and ends at a particular time too.<!-- page 023 -->
Elder Augustine suggested that there is both a place for talking about reconciliation and a need for quiet reflection.<!-- page 023 -->
Reconciliation cannot occur without listening, contemplation, meditation, and deeper internal deliberation.<!-- page 023 -->
Silence in the face of residential school harms is an appropriate response for many Indigenous peoples.<!-- page 023 -->
We must enlarge the space for respectful silence in journeying towards reconciliation, particularly for Survivors who regard this as key to healing.<!-- page 023 -->
There is a place for discussion and negotiation for those who want to move beyond silence.<!-- page 023 -->
Dialogue and mutual adjustment are significant components of Mi’kmaq law.<!-- page 023 -->
Elder Augustine suggested that other dimensions of human experience—our relationships with the earth and all living beings—are also relevant in working towards reconciliation.<!-- page 023 -->
This profound insight is an Indigenous law, which could be applied more generally.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^46</a><!-- page 023 --></p>
<p>Elder Reg Crowshoe told the Commission that Indigenous peoples’ world views, oral history traditions, and practices have much to teach us about how to establish respectful relationships among peoples and with the land and all living things.<!-- page 023 -->
Learning how to live together in a good way happens through sharing stories and practising reconciliation in our everyday lives.<!-- page 023 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>When we talk about the concept of reconciliation, I think about some of the stories that I’ve heard in our culture and stories are important…<!-- page 023 -->
These stories are so important as theories but at the same time stories are important to oral cultures.<!-- page 023 -->
So when we talk about stories, we talk about defining our environment and how we look at authorities that come from the land and how that land, when we talk about our relationship with the land, how we look at forgiveness and reconciliation is so important when we look at it historically.<!-- page 023 --></p>
<p>We have stories in our culture about our superheroes, how we treat each other, stories about how animals and plants give us authorities and privileges to use plants as healing, but we also have stories about practices.<!-- page 023 -->
How would we practise reconciliation?<!-- page 023 -->
How would we practise getting together to talk about reconciliation in an oral perspective?<!-- page 023 -->
And those practices are so important.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^47</a><!-- page 023 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As Elder Crowshoe explained further, reconciliation requires talking, but our conversations must be broader than Canada’s conventional approaches.<!-- page 023 -->
Reconciliation between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Canadians, from an Aboriginal perspective, also requires reconciliation with the natural world.<!-- page 023 --><!-- page 024 -->
If human beings resolve problems between themselves but continue to destroy the natural world, then reconciliation remains incomplete.<!-- page 024 -->
This is a perspective that we as Commissioners have repeatedly heard: that reconciliation will never occur unless we are also reconciled with the earth.<!-- page 024 -->
Mi’kmaq and other Indigenous laws stress that humans must journey through life in conversation and negotiation with all creation.<!-- page 024 -->
Reciprocity and mutual respect help sustain our survival.<!-- page 024 -->
It is this kind of healing and survival that is needed in moving forward from the residential school experience.<!-- page 024 --></p>
<p>Over the course of its work, the Commission created space for exploring the meanings and concepts of reconciliation.<!-- page 024 -->
In public Sharing Circles at National Events and Community Hearings, we bore witness to powerful moments of truth sharing and humbling acts of reconciliation.<!-- page 024 -->
Many Survivors had never been able to tell their own families the whole truth of what happened to them in the schools.<!-- page 024 -->
At hearings in Regina, Saskatchewan, Elder Kirby Littletent said, “I never told, I just told my children, my grandchildren I went to boarding school, that’s all.<!-- page 024 -->
I never shared my experiences.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^48</a><!-- page 024 --></p>
<p>Many spoke to honour the memory of relatives who have passed on.<!-- page 024 -->
Simone, an Inuk Survivor from Chesterfield Inlet, Nunavut, said,<!-- page 024 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m here for my parents—‘Did you miss me when I went away?’ ‘Did you cry for me?’—and I’m here for my brother, who was a victim, and my niece at the age of five who suffered a head injury and never came home, and her parents never had closure.<!-- page 024 -->
To this day, they have not found the grave in Winnipeg.<!-- page 024 -->
And I’m here for them first, and that’s why I’m making a public statement.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^49</a><!-- page 024 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Others talked about the importance of reconciling with family members, and cautioned that this process is just beginning.<!-- page 024 -->
Patrick Etherington, a Survivor from St.<!-- page 024 -->
Anne’s residential school in Fort Albany, Ontario, walked with his son and others from Cochrane, Ontario, to the National Event in Winnipeg.<!-- page 024 -->
He said that the walk helped him to reconnect with his son, and that he “just wanted to be here because I feel this process that we are starting, we got a long ways to go.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^50</a><!-- page 024 --></p>
<p>We saw the children and grandchildren of Survivors who, in searching for their own identity and place in the world, found compassion and gained new respect for their relatives who went to the schools, once they heard about and began to understand their experiences.<!-- page 024 -->
At the Northern National Event in Inuvik, Northwest Territories, Maxine Lacorne said,<!-- page 024 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a youth, a young lady, I talk with people my age because I have a good understanding.<!-- page 024 -->
I talk to people who are residential school Survivors because I like to hear their stories, you know, and it gives me more understanding of my parents…<!-- page 024 -->
It is an honour to be here, to sit here among you guys, Survivors.<!-- page 024 -->
Wow.<!-- page 024 -->
You guys are strong people, you guys survived everything.<!-- page 024 -->
And we’re still going to be here.<!-- page 024 -->
They tried to take us away.<!-- page 024 --><!-- page 025 -->
They tried to take our language away.<!-- page 025 -->
You guys are still here, we’re still here.<!-- page 025 -->
I’m still here.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^51</a><!-- page 025 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="Truth and Reconciliation Commission Northern National Event, Inuvik, Northwest Territories, June 2011." src="image-autofix/page-025.jpg" /><!-- page 025 --></p>
<p>We heard about children whose small acts of everyday resistance in the face of rampant abuse, neglect, and bullying in the schools were quite simply heroic.<!-- page 025 -->
At the TRC British Columbia National Event, Elder Barney Williams said that “many of us, through our pain and suffering, managed to hold our heads up …<!-- page 025 -->
we were brave children.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^52</a><!-- page 025 -->
We saw old bonds of childhood friendship renewed as people gathered and found each other at TRC-sponsored events.<!-- page 025 -->
Together, they remembered the horrors they had endured even as they recalled with pride long-forgotten accomplishments in various school sports teams, music, or art activities.<!-- page 025 -->
We heard from resilient, courageous Survivors who, despite their traumatic childhood experiences, went on to become influential leaders in their communities and in all walks of Canadian life, including politics, government, law, education, medicine, the corporate world, and the arts.<!-- page 025 --></p>
<p>We heard from officials representing the federal government that administered the schools.<!-- page 025 -->
In a Sharing Circle at the Manitoba National Event, the Honourable Chuck Strahl (then minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development Canada) said,<!-- page 025 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Governments like to write …<!-- page 025 -->
policy, and they like to write legislation, and they like to codify things and so on.<!-- page 025 -->
And Aboriginal people want to talk about restoration, reconciliation, forgiveness, about healing …<!-- page 025 -->
about truth.<!-- page 025 -->
And those things are all things of the heart and of relationship, and not of government policy.<!-- page 025 --><!-- page 026 -->
Governments do a bad job of that.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^53</a><!-- page 026 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Church representatives spoke about their struggles to right the relationship with Aboriginal peoples.<!-- page 026 -->
In Inuvik, Anglican Archbishop Fred Hiltz told us that<!-- page 026 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>as a Church, we are renewing our commitment to work with the Assembly of First Nations in addressing long-standing, Indigenous justice issues.<!-- page 026 -->
As a Church, we are requiring anyone who serves the Church at a national level to go through anti-racism training…<!-- page 026 -->
We have a lot to do in our Church to make sure that racism is eliminated.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^54</a><!-- page 026 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Educators told us about their growing awareness of the inadequate role that post-secondary institutions played in training the teachers who taught in the schools.<!-- page 026 -->
They have pledged to change educational practices and curriculum to be more inclusive of Aboriginal knowledge and history.<!-- page 026 -->
Artists shared their ideas and feelings about truth and reconciliation through songs, paintings, dance, film, and other media.<!-- page 026 -->
Corporations provided resources to bring Survivors to events, and, in some cases, some of their own staff and managers.<!-- page 026 --></p>
<p>For non-Aboriginal Canadians who came to bear witness to Survivors’ life stories, the experience was powerful.<!-- page 026 -->
One woman said simply, “By listening to your story, my story can change.<!-- page 026 -->
By listening to your story, I can change.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^55</a><!-- page 026 --></p>
</section></section><section class="section2" id="reconciliation-as-relationship"><h2><a class="toclink" href="#reconciliation-as-relationship">Reconciliation as relationship<!-- page 026 --></a></h2>
<p>In its 2012 <em>Interim Report</em>, the TRC recommended that federal, provincial, and territorial governments, and all parties to the Settlement Agreement, undertake to meet and explore the <em>United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples</em>, as a framework for reconciliation in Canada.<!-- page 026 -->
We remain convinced that the <em>United Nations Declaration</em> provides the necessary principles, norms, and standards for reconciliation to flourish in twenty-first-century Canada.<!-- page 026 --></p>
<p>A reconciliation framework is one in which Canada’s political and legal systems, educational and religious institutions, the corporate sector and civic society function in ways that are consistent with the principles set out in the <em>United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples</em>, which Canada has endorsed.<!-- page 026 -->
Together, Canadians must do more than just talk about reconciliation; we must learn how to <em>practise</em> reconciliation in our everyday lives—within ourselves and our families, and in our communities, governments, places of worship, schools, and workplaces.<!-- page 026 -->
To do so constructively, Canadians must remain committed to the ongoing work of establishing and maintaining respectful relationships.<!-- page 026 --></p>
<p>For many Survivors and their families, this commitment is foremost about healing themselves, their communities, and nations, in ways that revitalize individuals as well as Indigenous cultures, languages, spirituality, laws, and governance systems.<!-- page 026 -->
For governments, building a respectful relationship involves dismantling a centuries-old political and bureaucratic culture in which, all too often, policies and programs are still based on failed notions of assimilation.<!-- page 026 --><!-- page 027 -->
For churches, demonstrating long-term commitment requires atoning for actions within the residential schools, respecting Indigenous spirituality, and supporting Indigenous peoples’ struggles for justice and equity.<!-- page 027 -->
Schools must teach history in ways that foster mutual respect, empathy, and engagement.<!-- page 027 -->
All Canadian children and youth deserve to know Canada’s honest history, including what happened in the residential schools, and to appreciate the rich history and knowledge of Indigenous nations who continue to make such a strong contribution to Canada, including our very name and collective identity as a country.<!-- page 027 -->
For Canadians from all walks of life, reconciliation offers a new way of living together.<!-- page 027 --></p>

<p>The Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada was established in 2008 under the terms of the Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement.<!-- page 033 -->
The Commission was mandated to<!-- page 033 --></p>
<ul>
<li>reveal to Canadians the complex truth about the history and the ongoing legacy of the church-run residential schools, in a manner that fully documents the individual and collective harms perpetrated against Aboriginal peoples, and honours the resilience and courage of former students, their families, and communities; and<!-- page 033 --></li>
<li>guide and inspire a process of truth and healing, leading toward reconciliation within Aboriginal families, and between Aboriginal peoples and non-Aboriginal communities, churches, governments, and Canadians generally.<!-- page 033 --></li>
</ul>
<p>The process was to work to renew relationships on a basis of inclusion, mutual understanding, and respect.<!-- page 033 -->
More specifically, the Commission was required to hold seven National Events; to gather documents and statements about residential schools and their legacy; to fund truth and reconciliation events at the community level; to recommend commemoration initiatives to the federal government for funding; to set up a research centre that will permanently house the Commission’s records and documents, which the parties were obligated to provide to the Commission, thereby establishing a living legacy of the Commission’s work; and to issue a report with recommendations.<!-- page 033 --></p>
<p>Three Commissioners were appointed in 2008: the Honourable Justice Harry Laforme as Chair, and Jane Brewin-Morley and Claudette Dumont-Smith.<!-- page 033 -->
They resigned shortly after being appointed and new Commissioners were appointed.<!-- page 033 -->
The current Commissioners, the Honourable Justice Murray Sinclair as Chair, and Chief Wilton Littlechild and Dr.<!-- page 033 -->
Marie Wilson, were appointed to replace them in 2009 by the parties to the Settlement Agreement.<!-- page 033 --></p>
<p>An Indian Residential School Survivor Committee (IRSSC) provided advice and support to the Commission.<!-- page 033 -->
Its members included John Banksland, Inuvialuit from the Northwest Territories; John Morriseau, Métis from Grand Rapids, Manitoba; Eugene Arcand, Cree from Muskeg Lake First Nation, Saskatchewan; Madeleine Basile, a member of the Atikamekw Nation from Wemotaci, Québec; Lottie May Johnson, Mi’kmaq from Eskasoni, Nova Scotia; Rebekah Uqi Williams, Inuk from Nunavut; Doris Young, Cree from The Pas, Manitoba; Barney Williams Jr. (Taa-eee-sim-chilth), Nuu-chah-nulth from the Tla-o-quiaht First Nations on Meares Island, British Columbia; Gordon Williams, from the Peguis First Nation in Manitoba, now residing in Ontario; and Kukdookaa Terri Brown, from the Tahltan Nation in British Columbia.<!-- page 033 --><!-- page 034 -->
Raymond Arcand, a former chief of the Alexander First Nation near Edmonton, Alberta, served on the Survivors Committee until his death in November 2009.<!-- page 034 --></p>

<p>The Commission received continuing support throughout its mandate from the parties to the Settlement Agreement.<!-- page 034 -->
Regular All Parties Meetings were held to discuss opportunities and challenges that arose in fulfilling the Commission’s goals.<!-- page 034 -->
The Commission worked with the parties to address topics such as document collection, communications, public education, and Survivor travel support for completion of the Commission’s work.<!-- page 034 -->
Representatives of the parties also took part in working groups at the national and local levels to support the Commission in planning and implementing its National and Regional Events.<!-- page 034 --></p>
<p>The Commission established its head office in Winnipeg, Manitoba, retained a small Ottawa office, and opened satellite offices in Vancouver, British Columbia; Hobbema, Alberta; and Yellowknife, Northwest Territories.<!-- page 034 --></p>
<p>In recognition of the unique cultures of the Inuit, and of their experiences and the impacts of residential schools on them, the Commission also established an Inuit SubCommission.<!-- page 035 -->
Seven regional liaison officers were hired with advice from the IRSSC and were assigned responsibility to work in the following regions: Québec and Atlantic Canada, Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta, British Columbia, and Yukon and the Northwest Territories.<!-- page 035 --></p>

<p>During the six years of its operation, the Commission held events in all parts of the country.<!-- page 035 -->
The largest and most visible of these were the National Events held in Winnipeg, Inuvik, Halifax, Saskatoon, Montreal, Vancouver, and Edmonton between June 2010 and March 2014.<!-- page 035 -->
The Commission estimates there were as many as 155,000 visits to the seven National Events; over 9,000 residential school Survivors registered to attend them (while many others attended but did not register).<a href="footnote-placeholder">^1</a><!-- page 035 -->
To augment its statement-gathering activities and to help build public interest and participation in its National Events, the TRC organized Regional Events in Victoria and Whitehorse.<!-- page 035 -->
It also held 238 days of local hearings in seventy-seven communities across the country.<!-- page 035 --></p>
<p>The Commission also sponsored “town halls” on reconciliation at its Victoria Regional Event in April 2012 and at subsequent National Events as a means to draw a greater number of visitors into conversation with the TRC about healing and reconciliation.<!-- page 035 -->
Members of the general public were invited to come forward at the town halls to share information about what they are already doing to support reconciliation and to describe their ideas about what more needs to be done.<!-- page 035 --></p>
</section><section class="section2" id="statement-gathering"><h2><a class="toclink" href="#statement-gathering">Statement gathering<!-- page 035 --></a></h2>
<p>Until the Commission was established, the voices of those who were most directly affected by the residential school experience, particularly the former students, had largely been missing from the historical record.<!-- page 035 -->
The Commission made a commitment to offer everyone involved with the residential school system the opportunity to speak about their experience.<!-- page 035 -->
The Commission received over 6,750 statements from Survivors of residential schools, members of their families, and other individuals who wished to share their knowledge of the residential school system and its legacy.<!-- page 035 --></p>
<p>Statements were gathered at public Sharing Panels and Sharing Circles at National, Regional, and Community Events and at Commission hearings.<!-- page 035 -->
They were also collected through private conversations with statement gatherers.<!-- page 035 -->
The Commission also gathered statements in correctional institutions in Kenora, Ontario, and Yellowknife, Northwest Territories, recognizing the high rates of incarceration of Aboriginal peoples and how the experience of residential schools has contributed to the kinds of personal struggles that may lead to incarceration.<!-- page 035 --><!-- page 036 -->
Health-support workers, cultural support workers, and/or professional therapists were present everywhere the Commission gathered statements to provide support and counselling as needed.<!-- page 036 --></p>
<p><img alt="The Kuujjuaq community hearing, Nunavik, March 2011. Photo credit: Piita Irniq." src="image-autofix/page-036.jpg" /><!-- page 036 --></p>
<p>In an effort to understand all aspects of the residential school experience, the Commission also made a concerted effort to gather statements from former staff of residential schools.<!-- page 036 -->
With the assistance of the church parties to the Settlement Agreement, the Commission conducted ninety-six separate interviews with former staff and the children of former staff.<!-- page 036 -->
In addition, the Commission received statements from former staff and their family members at its National and Regional Events and Community Hearings.<!-- page 036 -->
The statements gathered will form part of a permanent collection of documents relating to residential schools.<!-- page 036 --></p>
<p>Under the terms of the Settlement Agreement, the federal government and the churches were obliged to turn over relevant documents in their possession to the Commission.<!-- page 036 -->
The Commission has had to overcome some significant challenges to completing this task, and has had to seek court direction to resolve disputes with the parties about the handing over of documents.<!-- page 036 --><!-- page 037 -->
Once the Commission’s document-collection processes began, it became increasingly apparent that Canada would not produce numerous documents that appeared to be relevant to the Commission’s work.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^2</a><!-- page 037 --></p>
<p>First, the federal government declined to produce all relevant documents held in its national archives, Library and Archives Canada.<!-- page 037 -->
Library and Archives Canada took a position that it was not required to organize and produce to the Commission up to five million documents in its possession that were directly relevant to residential schools.<!-- page 037 -->
Library and Archives Canada maintained that the Settlement Agreement required it to provide the Commission only with access to its archives.<!-- page 037 -->
A lengthy process, which included the filing of written arguments, affidavit evidence, and court-ordered mediation between Canada and the Commission, culminated in a hearing before the Honourable Justice Stephen Goudge of the Ontario Court of Appeal (sitting as an Ontario Superior Court Justice) on December 20 and 21, 2012.<!-- page 037 -->
By judgment dated January 30, 2013, Justice Goudge ruled in favour of the Commission’s position, that the terms of the Settlement Agreement provided that all relevant documents held by the Government of Canada, wherever they may be held, must be produced to the Commission.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^3</a><!-- page 037 -->
Following the ruling, the Government of Canada began producing documents from Library and Archives Canada to the Commission.<!-- page 037 --></p>
<p>Less than a year later, the Commission once again was required to go to court for judicial guidance respecting Canada’s document-production obligations.<!-- page 037 -->
At issue were records in the possession of the Government of Canada from the investigation of the Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) into abuse at the Fort Albany, Ontario, residential school in Ontario (also known as the St. Anne’s school).<!-- page 037 -->
The Commission had attempted to obtain the OPP documents from both the OPP and the federal government.<!-- page 037 -->
Although the OPP did not respond to the Commission’s overtures, it later took the position that it required judicial authorization to produce the records to the Commission, but it did not oppose disclosure.<!-- page 037 -->
The Government of Canada, however, opposed production of the documents to both the Commission and to the lawyers for residential school Survivors.<!-- page 037 -->
The government took the position that it was barred from producing the documents because they obtained the documents from the OPP subject to an undertaking that it would not, in turn, disclose the documents to any third party.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^4</a><!-- page 037 -->
The Government of Canada further argued that it was not obliged to seek documents from third parties for disclosure to the Commission and that any disclosure to the Commission of the St. Anne’s records would amount to burdening the Government of Canada with this obligation.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^5</a><!-- page 037 --></p>
<p>On October 18, 2013, the Commission filed a Request for Directions as to whether the Government of Canada was obliged to disclose the records of the OPP investigation of St. Anne’s.<!-- page 037 -->
After argument before the Honourable Justice Paul Perell of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice on December 17 and 18, 2013, the court ordered Canada to produce its documents to the Commission.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^6</a><!-- page 037 -->
Recognizing that Canada had only a subset of the OPP investigation documents, the court went one step further and ordered that the OPP produce all the investigation records in its possession to the Commission.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^7</a><!-- page 037 --></p>
<p>Less than a year after Justice Perell rendered his decision in the St.<!-- page 038 -->
Anne’s case, the Commission was faced with yet another document-collection issue that called for court guidance.<!-- page 038 -->
The documents at issue were records from the Independent Assessment Process (IAP).<!-- page 038 -->
The IAP is one of the components of the Settlement Agreement.<!-- page 038 -->
The IAP is an adjudicative process for financial compensation to residential school Survivors who suffered serious abuse at residential schools.<!-- page 038 -->
Consequently, the body that administers the IAP process, the Indian Residential Schools Adjudication Secretariat (IRSAS), is in possession of a wealth of documents relevant to the legacy of Indian residential schools.<!-- page 038 --></p>
<p>The Residential Schools Settlement Agreement provides that Survivors who go through the IAP can give their consent to have their statements and testimony archived with the archive created by the National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation for future research.<!-- page 038 -->
The intention was apparently to eliminate the need for a Survivor to have to testify before an IAP adjudicator, and then have to repeat the same story to the TRC.<!-- page 038 -->
From mid-2010 to early 2012, the Commission engaged in negotiations with IRSAS to archive and preserve those documents.<!-- page 038 -->
The parties’ discussions focused on the development of a consent form for IAP claimants to sign during the IAP process.<!-- page 038 -->
The consent form would explain to IAP Survivors how their information would be shared with the Commission and it would allow them to provide written consent to the sharing of their stories.<!-- page 038 -->
The Commission had discovered that the IAP staff and adjudicators had repeatedly failed to inform Survivors of their right to have their statements delivered to the TRC’s archive, and, instead, had required an undertaking of strict confidentiality of all parties to the IAP hearings, including the Survivors themselves.<!-- page 038 -->
In June 2014, the chief adjudicator of IAP publicly announced that he supported the immediate destruction of all documents related to the adjudication of claims by residential school Survivors.<!-- page 038 --></p>
<p>The Commission emphasized that the requirement of strict confidentiality imposed by IRSAS was incompatible with the terms of the Settlement Agreement.<!-- page 038 -->
Furthermore, the Commission stated that the destruction of some IAP documents would constitute a major loss for future generations of Canadians.<!-- page 038 -->
The Commission and IRSAS were unable to come to an agreement as to the mechanisms for allowing the Commission to access the documents, and the matter was brought before Justice Perell for direction.<!-- page 038 --></p>
<p>In the hearing held from July 14 to 16, 2014, the Commission advanced the position that a notice program should be ordered by the court, which would allow IAP claimants to be notified that they may share their IAP testimony with the Commission should they so desire.<!-- page 038 -->
The Commission narrowed the categories of documents it sought to preserve in recognition of the legitimate privacy interests of IAP Survivors.<!-- page 038 -->
The Commission argued that it sought only to archive the IAP applications, transcripts, and audio recordings from IAP hearings and IAP adjudicator decisions.<!-- page 038 --></p>
<p>On August 6, 2014, Justice Perell delivered reasons in which he held that the IAP documents would be subject to a fifteen-year retention period, during which a notice program to Survivors would be administered by the Commission or the National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^8</a><!-- page 038 --><!-- page 039 -->
The precise parameters of the notice program would be decided by the court in a subsequent hearing.<!-- page 039 -->
Importantly, Justice Perell ruled that every copy of the IAP documents, no matter who possesses them, must be destroyed after the conclusion of the retention period if the IAP claimants do not consent to having the documents archived.<!-- page 039 --></p>
<p>Justice Perell also directed that the Commission commence a further Request for Direction and return to court for a determination of the issue of the parameters of a notice program to inform Survivors about their option to archive their IAP applications, the transcripts and audio recordings of their hearings, and the decisions with the Commission.<!-- page 039 -->
The Commission (along with the National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation) has been entrusted to commence further proceedings to determine how to engage claimants in the exercise of ensuring informed consent on the issue of the fate of their records.<!-- page 039 --></p>
<p>Justice Perell’s ruling is the subject of appeal.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^9</a><!-- page 039 -->
The Commission feels strongly that any steps taken to ensure that the informed consent of Survivors is obtained must be robust, culturally appropriate, and sensitive to the challenges of contacting Survivors, some of whom cannot read, have problems speaking English or French, and reside in remote locations.<!-- page 039 -->
The Commission believes that it is not enough that a notice simply be mailed to the last known address of Survivors.<!-- page 039 -->
A multi-faceted and personal approach that actively engages Survivors is required.<!-- page 039 --></p>
<p>The Commission strongly believes that Survivors’ stories must be preserved.<!-- page 039 -->
The loss of these documents would be a blow to Canada’s national memory of a significant historic injustice, could contribute to the possibility that future generations would never know of the abuses in residential schools, and could contribute to the argument of those who would assert that this never happened.  The Commission intends to vigorously advance a position to prevent the destruction of the IAP documents without the informed consent of individual Survivors.<!-- page 039 --></p>
</section><section class="section2" id="the-national-events"><h2><a class="toclink" href="#the-national-events">The National Events<!-- page 039 --></a></h2>
<p>The four-day National Events served as important milestones over the course of the Commission’s six-year mandate.<!-- page 039 -->
As well as offering a forum for Survivors and their families, the National Events raised public awareness of the history and legacy of residential schools.<!-- page 039 -->
They also built momentum for the collective journey towards national healing and reconciliation—a journey that will need to continue well beyond the Commission’s closing ceremony.<!-- page 039 --></p>
<p>Traditional knowledge and practice guided much of the Commission’s work.<!-- page 039 -->
The Seven Sacred Teachings of the Anishinaabe—Respect, Courage, Love, Truth, Humility, Honesty, and Wisdom—served as the themes for the seven National Events, and ceremony and traditional observance played an important part in the National Events.<!-- page 039 -->
Sacred fires were lit at the beginning of each National Event and every day’s proceedings began with ceremony.<!-- page 039 --></p>
<p><img alt="Concert showcasing local Aboriginal talent, Atlantic National Event, Halifax, 2011." src="image-autofix/page-040.jpg" /><!-- page 040 --></p>
<p>As much as possible, the observances followed the cultural protocols, customs, and traditions of the Aboriginal peoples in whose territories the Commission was a guest.<!-- page 040 -->
Similar ceremonies were held at Regional and Community Events.<!-- page 040 --></p>
<p>Education was a key part of the Commission’s mandate.<!-- page 040 -->
Although students were involved in all the National Events, beginning at the third National Event in Halifax, and at all subsequent National Events, local schools were invited to send students to take part in a day of learning.<!-- page 040 -->
These Education Days were also part of Regional Events on Vancouver Island and in Yukon, and a stand-alone event was organized in Toronto for students from the surrounding area.<!-- page 040 -->
In all, more than 15,000 students participated by attending presentations and cultural performances, observing and taking part in panel discussions and workshops, and visiting displays in the Learning Places.<!-- page 040 --></p>
<p>The Commission organized activities to help teachers prepare their students for the National Event Education Days and consider follow-up activities in the classroom.<!-- page 040 -->
In addition, the Commission worked with universities, educators, and Traditional Knowledge Keepers to hold academic conferences and panel discussions at its National Events on a number of topics related to the legacy of colonialism and residential schools, and on healing and reconciliation.<!-- page 040 --></p>
<p>Cultural performances were also key elements of each National Event.<!-- page 040 -->
Through concerts and talent shows, thousands of people experienced some of the richness of Aboriginal culture, language, and artistic expression—cultural forms that residential schools sought to destroy.<!-- page 040 --><!-- page 041 --></p>
<p><img alt="Her Excellency, the Honorable Michaëlle Jean at the Winnipeg National Event, June 2010." src="image-autofix/page-041.jpg" /><!-- page 041 --></p>
<p>The Commission was able to share its work with Canadians everywhere, and with a worldwide audience, through live streaming of the National Events on the internet and additional postings on the Commission’s website and social-media platforms.<!-- page 041 -->
There were over 93,350 views of its webcast during the National Events from at least sixty-two different countries.<!-- page 041 --></p>
<section class="section3" id="witnessing-and-expressions-of-reconciliation"><h3><a class="toclink" href="#witnessing-and-expressions-of-reconciliation">Witnessing and expressions of reconciliation<!-- page 041 --></a></h3>
<p>One of the goals of the Commission’s public outreach activities was to encourage Canadians from all backgrounds to learn more about the legacy of residential schools and take part in the work of reconciliation by witnessing Commission events.<!-- page 041 --></p>
<p>Inviting respected guests to represent all witnesses at an event or the conduct of business gives the event import and legitimacy and is in keeping with the traditions of many Aboriginal cultures.<!-- page 041 -->
To this end, the Commission appointed Honorary Witnesses to be present at its major events.<!-- page 041 -->
Her Excellency, the Right Honourable Michaëlle Jean, who served as governor general of Canada at the start of the Commission’s mandate, agreed to be the Commission’s first Honorary Witness.<!-- page 041 -->
She began her role as a witness by hosting a special event called Witnessing the Future at Rideau Hall in Ottawa on October 15, 2009.<!-- page 041 --><!-- page 042 -->
In the following years, the current governor general of Canada, His Excellency the Right Honourable David Johnston; two former prime ministers, the Right Honourable Joe Clark and the Right Honourable Paul Martin; two former national Aboriginal leaders, Chief Phil Fontaine of the Assembly of First Nations and former Ambassador Mary Simon, Past President of Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami; and a host of other distinguished individuals have all agreed to serve as Honorary Witnesses.<!-- page 042 --></p>
<p>The Commission also invited Canadians to make expressions of reconciliation at its National and Regional Events.<!-- page 042 -->
The Commission received more than 180 expressions from individuals, organizations, and the parties to the Settlement Agreement who wished to publicly state their commitment to the journey of healing and reconciliation and speak to the ways in which they are contributing to that journey.<!-- page 042 -->
Documents and items related to each expression of reconciliation were placed in ceremony in the beautiful Bentwood Box created by Coast Salish carver Luke Marston.<!-- page 042 -->
The box will become part of the permanent legacy of the TRC housed in the National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation.<!-- page 042 --></p>
</section></section><section class="section2" id="education-and-outreach"><h2><a class="toclink" href="#education-and-outreach">Education and outreach<!-- page 042 --></a></h2>
<p>The Commission worked throughout its mandate to educate the public about the legacy of residential schools and to invite and encourage public participation in its events and activities.<!-- page 042 -->
The Commission took part in nearly 900 separate events.<!-- page 042 -->
These included a number of special events that the TRC organized with various partners to engage with Survivors’ organizations and other Aboriginal groups, youth, women, faith communities, the philanthropic community, and new Canadians.<!-- page 042 -->
The Commission also accepted invitations to share information about its work internationally through the United Nations, the International Centre for Transitional Justice, and a number of university law faculties.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^10</a><!-- page 042 --></p>
<p>In the final year of its mandate, the Commission organized two events to gather additional information for its report.<!-- page 042 -->
It held a Traditional Knowledge Keepers Forum to learn how traditional Aboriginal knowledge can contribute to reconciliation.<!-- page 042 -->
It also organized, with the support of Égale Canada Human Rights Trust, a forum with members of the Two Spirit community to discuss the impacts of residential schools and what needs to be done to support reconciliation and healing in that community.<!-- page 042 --></p>

<p>The Settlement Agreement allocated $20 million for commemoration initiatives.<!-- page 042 -->
These were defined as initiatives that would honour, educate, remember, memorialize, and pay tribute to former residential school students, their families, and their communities.<!-- page 042 -->
The Commission issued two separate calls for commemoration project proposals.<!-- page 042 --><!-- page 043 -->
The maximum funding award for a project advanced by a single group was $50,000.<!-- page 043 -->
Up to ten communities could collaborate on a submission for a maximum contribution of $500,000, and a commemoration project of national scope was eligible for a contribution of up to $2 million.<!-- page 043 -->
The Commission recommended 152 projects to the federal Department of Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development for funding, and 143 projects were approved.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^11</a><!-- page 043 --></p>
<p>It is important to note that the Commission’s work inspired others to undertake commemorative projects using their own resources.<!-- page 043 -->
One example is the Government of Canada’s decision to memorialize the legacy of Indian residential schools through the permanent installation of a stained-glass window in the Centre Block of Parliament Hill.<!-- page 043 -->
The design selected for the window was created by Aboriginal artist Christi Belcourt and is entitled <strong>Giniigaaniimenaaning</strong> or <strong>Looking Ahead</strong>.<!-- page 043 --></p>
<p>The Commission issued a separate call for proposals for community events and allocated funding to approved projects up to a maximum of $15,000 per event.<!-- page 043 -->
The TRC supported seventy-five community events, which were designed to promote healing and reconciliation by developing collective community narratives about the impact of the residential school system on former students, families, and communities.<!-- page 043 --></p>
</section><section class="section2" id="interim-report"><h2><a class="toclink" href="#interim-report">Interim report<!-- page 043 --></a></h2>
<p>In February 2012, as part of its mandate, the Commission issued an <em>Interim Report</em> with findings and recommendations, along with a short history of residential schools, entitled <em>They Came for the Children</em>.<!-- page 043 -->
Because recommendations in the <em>Interim Report</em> dealt with gaps in school curricula, the Commission made it a priority to meet with provincial and territorial education ministers to advocate for the development of curriculum on the legacy of residential schools and the mandatory adoption of that curriculum in all jurisdictions.<!-- page 043 --></p>
</section><section class="section2" id="national-centre-for-truth-and-reconciliation"><h2><a class="toclink" href="#national-centre-for-truth-and-reconciliation">National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation<!-- page 043 --></a></h2>
<p>The Commission was mandated to create a national research centre, which would hold all the material created and received as part of its work.<!-- page 043 -->
The centre is intended to be accessible to Survivors, their families, and communities, as well as to the general public.<!-- page 043 -->
The Commission held a forum in March 2011 to consult with national and international experts on establishing such a centre.<!-- page 043 -->
This informed the Commission’s subsequent call for proposals to house the centre.<!-- page 043 --></p>
<p>The Commission reviewed a number of proposals for housing the research centre and, in June 2013, announced that the University of Manitoba had been selected to become the permanent host of the National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation (NCTR).<!-- page 043 -->
The NCTR is governed by a Trust Deed and Administrative Agreement signed by the Commission and the university.<!-- page 043 --><!-- page 044 -->
A Governing Circle and Survivors Circle play important roles in ensuring the promises undertaken to Survivors are honoured.<!-- page 044 --></p>
<p><img alt="Tens of thousands participate in the Walk for Reconciliation through downtown Vancouver, September 2013." src="image-autofix/page-044.jpg" /><!-- page 044 --></p>
<p>The NCTR also works in direct partnership with a growing number of universities, colleges, and other organizations across the country, including: the University of British Columbia, the University of Winnipeg, l’Université de St.<!-- page 044 -->
Boniface, Carleton University, the University of Regina, Lakehead University, University College of the North, Algoma University, Red River College, the Archives of Manitoba, the Canadian Museum for Human Rights, the National Association of Friendship Centres, the Legacy of Hope Foundation, and le Centre du patrimoine.<!-- page 044 -->
The goal is to create the broadest possible network from coast to coast to coast.<!-- page 044 --></p>
<p>Officially opening in the summer of 2015, the NCTR will be the permanent home for all statements, documents, and other materials gathered by the Commission.<!-- page 044 -->
In future, it will house other Indigenous collections.<!-- page 044 -->
The NCTR will encourage and engage in respectful dialogue on many issues that hinder or foster reconciliation.<!-- page 044 -->
It will ensure that:<!-- page 044 --></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Survivors and their families have access to their own history;<!-- page 044 --></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>educators can share the residential school history with new generations of students;<!-- page 044 --></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>researchers can delve more deeply into the residential school experience and legacy;<!-- page 044 --></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the public can access historical records and other materials to help foster reconciliation and healing; and<!-- page 044 --></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the history and legacy of the residential school system are never forgotten.<!-- page 045 --></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The search to understand the truth about Indian residential schools has taken the Truth and Reconciliation Commission to all parts of Canada.<!-- page 045 -->
The Commission has listened to thousands of Survivors give their accounts of the residential school experience and how that experience has shaped their lives.<!-- page 045 -->
The Commission has explored what the legacy of the residential school system has meant to Aboriginal people in particular and to Canada as a whole.<!-- page 045 -->
This journey led the Commission to chart some of the pathways described in this report that may lead eventually to reconciliation within this country.<!-- page 045 --></p>

<p>It can start with a knock on the door one morning.<!-- page 047 -->
It is the local Indian agent, or the parish priest, or, perhaps, a Mounted Police officer.<!-- page 047 -->
The bus for residential school leaves that morning.<!-- page 047 -->
It is a day the parents have long been dreading.<!-- page 047 -->
Even if the children have been warned in advance, the morning’s events are still a shock.<!-- page 047 -->
The officials have arrived and the children must go.<!-- page 047 --></p>
<p>For tens of thousands of Aboriginal children for over a century, this was the beginning of their residential schooling.<!-- page 047 -->
They were torn from their parents, who often surrendered them only under threat of prosecution.<!-- page 047 -->
Then, they were hurled into a strange and frightening place, one in which their parents and culture would be demeaned and oppressed.<!-- page 047 --></p>
<p>For Frederick Ernest Koe, it started when the Anglican minister and the Mounted Police arrived with a message that he had to leave his parents’ home in Aklavik in the Northwest Territories that morning.<!-- page 047 -->

Florence Horassi was taken to the Fort Providence, Northwest Territories, school in a small airplane.<!-- page 048 -->
On its way to the school, the plane stopped at a number of small communities to pick up students.<!-- page 048 -->
“When the plane took off, there’s about six or five older ones, didn’t cry, but I saw tears come right out of their eyes.<!-- page 048 -->
Everybody else was crying.<!-- page 048 -->

<p>On their arrival at residential school, students often were required to exchange the clothes they were wearing for school-supplied clothing.<!-- page 049 -->

Murray Crowe said his clothes from home were taken and burned at the school that he attended in northwestern Ontario.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^16</a><!-- page 049 -->

<p>The only reason Bernice Jacks had wanted to go to residential school was to be with her older sister.<!-- page 051 -->
But once she was there, she discovered they were to sleep in separate dormitories.<!-- page 051 -->
On the occasions when she slipped into the older girls’ dormitory and crawled into her sister’s bed, her sister scolded her and sent her away: “My sister never talked to me like that before.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^24</a><!-- page 051 -->

<p>Taken from their homes, stripped of their belongings, and separated from their siblings, residential school children lived in a world dominated by fear, loneliness, and lack of affection.<!-- page 051 --></p>
<p>William Herney, who attended the Shubenacadie school in Nova Scotia, recalled the first few days in the school as being frightening and bewildering.<!-- page 051 -->
“Within those few days, you had to learn, because otherwise you’re gonna get your head knocked off.<!-- page 051 -->
Anyway, you learned everything.<!-- page 051 -->

Betsy Annahatak grew up in Kangirsuk, in northern Québec, which was then known as Payne Bay.<!-- page 052 -->
When her parents were on the land, she lived in a small hostel in the community.<!-- page 052 -->
“When one person would start crying, all the, all the little girls would start crying; all of us.<!-- page 052 -->
We were different ages.<!-- page 052 -->
And we would cry like little puppies or dogs, right into the night, until we go to sleep; longing for our families.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^35</a><!-- page 052 --></p>
<p>Students’ hearts were hardened.<!-- page 052 -->
Rick Gilbert remembered the Williams Lake, British Columbia, school as a loveless place.<!-- page 052 -->
“That was one thing about this school was that when you got hurt or got beat up or something, and you started crying, nobody comforted you.<!-- page 052 -->
You just sat in the corner and cried and cried till you got tired of crying then you got up and carried on with life.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^36</a><!-- page 052 -->
Nick Sibbeston, who was placed in the Fort Providence school in the Northwest Territories at the age of five, recalled it as a place where children hid their emotions.<!-- page 052 -->

Lydia Ross, who attended the Cross Lake school in Manitoba, said, “If you cried, if you got hurt and cried, there was no, nobody to, nobody to comfort, comfort you, nobody to put their arms.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^40</a><!-- page 052 -->
Stephen Kakfwi, who attended Grollier Hall in Inuvik and Grandin College in Fort Smith, Northwest Territories, said this lack of compassion affected the way students treated one another.<!-- page 052 -->
“No hugs, nothing, no comfort.<!-- page 052 -->
Everything that, I think, happened in the residential schools, we picked it up: we didn’t get any hugs; you ain’t going to get one out of me I’ll tell you that.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^41</a><!-- page 052 -->
Victoria McIntosh said that life at the Fort Alexander, Manitoba, school taught her not to trust anyone.<!-- page 052 -->

You just get harder.<!-- page 052 -->
And yeah, you learn to shut down.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^42</a><!-- page 052 --></p>
<p>These accounts all come from statements made by former residential school students to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada.<!-- page 052 -->
These events all took place in Canada within the realm of living memory.<!-- page 052 -->
Like previous generations of residential school children, these children were sent to what were, in most cases, badly constructed, poorly maintained, overcrowded, unsanitary fire traps.<!-- page 052 -->
Many children were fed a substandard diet and given a substandard education, and worked too hard.<!-- page 052 --><!-- page 053 -->
For far too long, they died in tragically high numbers.<!-- page 053 -->
Discipline was harsh and unregulated; abuse was rife and unreported.<!-- page 053 -->
It was, at best, institutionalized child neglect.<!-- page 053 --></p>
<p>The people who built, funded, and operated the schools offered varying justifications for this destructive intrusion into the lives of Aboriginal families.<!-- page 053 -->
Through it, they wished to turn the children into farmers and farmers’ wives.<!-- page 053 -->
They wanted the children to abandon their Aboriginal identity and come to know the Christian god.<!-- page 053 -->
They feared that if the children were not educated, they would be a menace to the social order of the country.<!-- page 053 -->
Canadian politicians wished to find a cheap way out of their long-term commitments to Aboriginal people.<!-- page 053 -->
Christian churches sought government support for their missionary efforts.<!-- page 053 -->
The schools were part of the colonization and conversion of Aboriginal people, and were intended to bring civilization and salvation to their children.<!-- page 053 -->
These were the rationales that were used to justify making the lives of so many children so unhappy.<!-- page 053 --></p>

<p>The mandate of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada requires it to report on “the history, purpose, operation and supervision” of Canada’s residential schools.<!-- page 053 -->
These schools were part of a process that brought European states and Christian churches together in a complex and powerful manner.<!-- page 053 -->
The history of the schools can be best understood in the context of this relationship between the growth of global, European-based empires and the Christian churches.<!-- page 053 -->
Starting in the sixteenth century, European states gained control of Indigenous peoples’ lands throughout the world.<!-- page 053 -->
It was an era of mass migration.<!-- page 053 -->
Millions of Europeans arrived as colonial settlers in nearly every part of the world.<!-- page 053 -->
Millions of Africans were transported in the European-led slave trade, in which coastal Africans collaborated.<!-- page 053 -->
Traders from India and China spread throughout the Red Sea and Indian Ocean, bringing with them indentured servants whose lives were little different from those of slaves.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^44</a><!-- page 053 -->
The activities of explorers, farmers, prospectors, trading companies, or missionaries often set the stage for expansionary wars, the negotiation and the breaking of Treaties, attempts at cultural assimilation, and the exploitation and marginalization of the original inhabitants of the colonized lands.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^45</a><!-- page 053 -->
Over time, Indigenous children in places as distant from one another as East Africa, Australia, and Siberia would be separated from their parents and sent to residential schools.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^46</a><!-- page 053 --><!-- page 054 --></p>

<p>The spread of European-based empires was set in motion in the fifteenth century when the voyages of maritime explorers revealed potential sources of new wealth to the monarchs of Europe.<!-- page 054 -->
The Spanish conquest of the Aztecs and the Incas gave Spain, and ultimately all of Europe, access to the resources of North and South America.<!-- page 054 -->
This not only enriched the Old World, but it also unleashed an unceasing wave of migration, trade, conquest, and colonization.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^47</a><!-- page 054 -->
It marked the beginning of the creation of a Europeandominated global economy.<!-- page 054 -->
Although it was led initially by Spain and Portugal, this era of imperial expansion came to be directed by Holland, France, and, in the end, most stunningly by Britain.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^48</a><!-- page 054 --></p>
<p>Empires were established militarily.<!-- page 054 -->
They engaged in extensive and violent wars with one another, maintained a military presence on their frontiers, and conducted innumerable military campaigns to put down nationalist uprisings.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^49</a><!-- page 054 -->
Colonies were established to be exploited economically.<!-- page 054 --><!-- page 055 -->
The benefits of empire could come directly as taxes, as precious metals, or as raw materials for industries in the homeland.<!-- page 055 -->
Colonies often were required to purchase their imports solely from the homeland, making them a captive market.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^50</a><!-- page 055 --></p>
<p>The mere presence of Indigenous people in these newly colonized lands blocked settler access to the land.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^51</a><!-- page 055 -->
To gain control of the land of Indigenous people, colonists negotiated Treaties, waged wars of extinction, eliminated traditional landholding practices, disrupted families, and imposed a political and spiritual order that came complete with new values and cultural practices.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^52</a><!-- page 055 -->
Treaty promises often went unfulfilled.<!-- page 055 -->
United States General William Tecumseh Sherman is quoted as having said, “We have made more than one thousand treaties with the various Indian tribes, and have not kept one of them.”<!-- page 055 -->
In commenting on Sherman’s statement in 1886, C. C. Painter, a critic of American Indian policy, observed that the United States had<!-- page 055 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>never intended to keep them. They were not made to be kept, but to serve a present purpose, to settle a present difficulty in the easiest manner possible, to acquire a desired good with the least possible compensation, and then to be disregarded as soon as this purpose was tainted and we were strong enough to enforce a new and more profitable arrangement.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^53</a><!-- page 055 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The outcome was usually disastrous for Indigenous people, while the chief beneficiaries of empire were the colonists and their descendants.<!-- page 055 -->
Many of the colonies they settled grew to be among the most prosperous societies in the late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century world.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^54</a><!-- page 055 -->
Settler colonies often went on to gain political independence.<!-- page 055 -->
In the case of Canada and the United States of America, these newly created nations spread across North America.<!-- page 055 -->
As they expanded, they continued to incorporate Indigenous peoples and their lands into empires.<!-- page 055 -->
Colonialism remains an ongoing process, shaping both the structure and the quality of the relationship between the settlers and Indigenous peoples.<!-- page 055 --></p>
<p>At their height, the European empires laid claim to most of the earth’s surface and controlled the seas.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^55</a><!-- page 055 -->
Numerous arguments were advanced to justify such extravagant interventions into the lands and lives of other peoples.<!-- page 055 -->
These were largely elaborations on two basic concepts: 1) the Christian god had given the Christian nations the right to colonize the lands they ‘discovered’ as long as they converted the Indigenous populations; and 2) the Europeans were bringing the benefits of civilization (a concept that was intertwined with Christianity) to the ‘heathen.’ In short, it was contended that people were being colonized for their own benefit, either in this world or the next.<!-- page 055 --></p>
<p>In the fifteenth century, the Roman Catholic Church, building on the traditions of the Roman Empire, conceived of itself as the guardian of a universal world order.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^56</a><!-- page 055 -->
The adoption of Christianity within the Roman Empire (which defined itself as ‘civilized’) reinforced the view that to be civilized was to be Christian.<!-- page 055 -->
The Catholic papacy was already playing a role in directing and legitimizing colonialism prior to Christopher Columbus’s voyages to the Americas in the 1490s, largely by granting Catholic kingdoms the right to colonize lands they ‘discovered.’57 In 1493, Pope Alexander VI issued the first of four orders, referred to as “papal bulls” (a term that takes its name from the Latin word for the mould used to seal the document), that granted most of North and South America to Spain, the kingdom that had sponsored Columbus’s voyage of the preceding year.<!-- page 055 --><!-- page 056 -->
These orders helped shape the political and legal arguments that have come to be referred to as the “Doctrine of Discovery,” which was used to justify the colonization of the Americas in the sixteenth century.<!-- page 056 -->
In return, the Spanish were expected to convert the Indigenous peoples of the Americas to Christianity.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^58</a><!-- page 056 --></p>
<p>Other European rulers rejected the Pope’s ability to give away sovereignty over half the world.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^59</a><!-- page 056 -->
But they did not necessarily reject the Doctrine of Discovery—they simply modified it.<!-- page 056 -->
The English argued that a claim to ‘discovered lands’ was valid if the ‘discoverer’ was able to take possession of them.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^60</a><!-- page 056 -->
Harman Verelst, who promoted the colonization in the eighteenth century of what is now the southern coast of the United States, wrote that “this Right arising from the first discovery is the first and fundamental Right of all European Nations, as to their Claim of Lands in America.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^61</a><!-- page 056 -->
This Doctrine of Discovery was linked to a second idea: the lands being claimed were terra nullius—no man’s land—and therefore open to claim.<!-- page 056 -->
On the basis of this concept, the British government claimed ownership of the entire Australian continent.<!-- page 056 -->
(There, the doctrine of terra nullius remained the law until it was successfully challenged in court in 1992.)<a href="footnote-placeholder">^62</a><!-- page 056 -->
Under this doctrine, imperialists could argue that the presence of Indigenous people did not void a claim of terra nullius, since the Indigenous people simply occupied, rather than owned, the land.<!-- page 056 -->
True ownership, they claimed, could come only with European-style agriculture.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^63</a><!-- page 056 --></p>
<p>Underlying these arguments was the belief that the colonizers were bringing civilization to savage people who could never civilize themselves.<!-- page 056 -->
The ‘civilizing mission’ rested on a belief of racial and cultural superiority.<!-- page 056 -->
European writers and politicians often arranged racial groups in a hierarchy, each with their own set of mental and physical capabilities.<!-- page 056 -->
The ‘special gifts’ of the Europeans meant it was inevitable that they would conquer the lesser peoples.<!-- page 056 -->
Beneath the Europeans, in descending order, were Asians, Africans, and the Indigenous peoples of the Americas and Australia.<!-- page 056 -->
Some people held that Europeans had reached the pinnacle of civilization through a long and arduous process.<!-- page 056 -->
In this view, the other peoples of the world had been held back by such factors as climate, geography, and migration.<!-- page 056 -->
Through a civilizing process, Europeans could, however, raise the people of the world up to their level.<!-- page 056 -->
This view was replaced in the nineteenth century by a racism that chose to cloak itself in the language of science, and held that the peoples of the world had differing abilities.<!-- page 056 -->
Some argued that, for genetic reasons, there were limits on the ability of the less-developed peoples to improve.<!-- page 056 -->
In some cases, it was thought, contact with superior races could lead to only one outcome: the extinction of the inferior peoples.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^64</a><!-- page 056 --></p>
<p>These ideas shaped global policies towards Indigenous peoples.<!-- page 056 -->
In 1883, Britain’s Lord Rosebery, a future British prime minister, told an Australian audience, “It is on the British race, whether in Great Britain, or the United States, or the Colonies, or wherever it may be, that rest the highest hopes of those who try to penetrate the dark future, or who seek to raise and better the patient masses of mankind.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^65</a><!-- page 056 --><!-- page 057 -->
Residential schools were established in the shadow of these ideas.<!-- page 057 -->
In the year that Rosebery gave this speech, the Canadian government opened its first industrial residential school for Aboriginal people at Battleford on the Canadian Prairies.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^66</a><!-- page 057 --></p>
<p><img alt="A Church Missionary Society school, in Freetown, Sierra Leone.

<p>The Christian churches not only provided the moral justification for the colonization of other peoples’ lands, but they also dispatched missionaries to the colonized nations in order to convert ‘the heathen.’ From the fifteenth century on, the Indigenous peoples of the world were the objects of a strategy of spiritual and cultural conquest that had its origins in Europe.<!-- page 057 -->
While they often worked in isolation and under difficult conditions, missionaries were representatives of worldwide organizations that enjoyed the backing of influential individuals in some of the most powerful nations of the world, and which came to amass considerable experience in transforming different cultures.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^67</a><!-- page 057 -->
Residential schools figured prominently in missionary work, not only in Canada, but also around the world.<!-- page 057 --></p>
<p>Christian missionaries played a complex but central role in the European colonial project.<!-- page 057 -->
Their presence helped justify the extension of empires, since they were visibly spreading the word of God to the heathen.<!-- page 057 -->
If their efforts were unsuccessful, the missionaries might conclude that those who refused to accept the Christian message could not expect the protection of the church or the law, thus clearing the way for their destruction.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^68</a><!-- page 057 -->
Although missionaries often attempted to soften the impact of imperialism, they were also committed to making the greatest changes in the culture and psychology of the colonized.<!-- page 057 --><!-- page 058 -->
They might, for example, seek to have traders give fair prices and to have government officials provide relief in times of need, but they also worked to undermine relationships to the land, language, religion, family relations, educational practices, morality, and social custom.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^69</a><!-- page 058 --></p>
<p>Missionary zeal was also fuelled by the often violent division that had separated the Christian world into Catholic and Protestant churches.<!-- page 058 -->
Both Catholics and Protestants invested heavily in the creation of missionary organizations that were intended to engage overseas missionary work.<!-- page 058 -->
The most well-known Catholic orders were the Franciscans, the Jesuits, and the Oblates.<!-- page 058 -->
The Oblates originally focused their attention on the poor and working classes of France, but from the 1830s onwards, they engaged in overseas missionary work.<!-- page 058 -->
They established themselves in eastern Canada, the Pacific Northwest, Ceylon, Texas, and Africa.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^70</a><!-- page 058 -->
The Oblates administered a majority of the Roman Catholic residential schools in Canada.<!-- page 058 -->
They could not have done this work without the support of a number of female religious orders, most particularly the Sisters of Charity (the Grey Nuns), the Sisters of Providence, the Sisters of St.<!-- page 058 -->
Anne, and the Missionary Oblate Sisters of the Sacred Heart and of Mary Immaculate.<!-- page 058 --></p>
<p>The British-based Church Missionary Society was also a global enterprise.<!-- page 058 -->
By the middle of the nineteenth century, this Anglican society had missions across the globe in such places as India, New Zealand, West and East Africa, China, and the Middle East.<!-- page 058 -->
The society’s Highbury College in London provided missionaries with several years of training in arithmetic, grammar, history, geography, religion, education, and the administration of schools.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^71</a><!-- page 058 -->
By 1901, the Church Missionary Society had an annual income of over 300,000 pounds.<!-- page 058 -->
It used this money to support 510 male missionaries, 326 unmarried females, and 365 ordained pastors around the world.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^72</a><!-- page 058 --></p>
<p>The Catholics and Anglicans were not the only European-based missionary societies to take up work in Canada.<!-- page 058 -->
Presbyterians and Methodists, originally drawing support from the United Kingdom, undertook missionary work among Aboriginal people in the early nineteenth century.<!-- page 058 -->
On the coast of Labrador, members of the Moravian Brotherhood, an order that had its origins in what is now the Czech Republic, carried out missionary work from the early eighteenth century onwards.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^73</a><!-- page 058 -->
Protestant missionary work also depended on the often underpaid and voluntary labour of missionary wives and single women who had been recruited by missionary societies.<!-- page 058 --></p>
<p>Missionaries viewed Aboriginal culture as a barrier to both spiritual salvation and the ongoing existence of Aboriginal people.<!-- page 058 -->
They were determined to replace traditional economic pursuits with European-style peasant agriculture.<!-- page 058 -->
They believed that cultural transformation required the imposition of social control and separation from both traditional communities and European settlements.<!-- page 058 -->
In the light of these beliefs, it is not surprising that they were proponents of an educational world that separated children from the influences of their families and cultures, imposed a new set of values and beliefs, provided a basic elementary education, and created institutions whose daily life reflected Europe’s emerging work discipline.<!-- page 058 --><!-- page 059 -->
In short, they sought to impose the foreign and transforming world of the residential school.<!-- page 059 --></p>
<p>Colonization was undertaken to meet the perceived needs of the imperial powers.<!-- page 059 -->
The justification offered for colonialism—the need to bring Christianity and civilization to the Indigenous peoples of the world—may have been a sincerely and firmly held belief, but as a justification for intervening in the lives of other peoples, it does not stand up to legal, moral, or even logical scrutiny.<!-- page 059 -->
The papacy had no authority to give away lands that belonged to Indigenous people.<!-- page 059 -->
The Doctrine of Discovery cannot serve as the basis for a legitimate claim to the lands that were colonized, if for no other reason than that the so-called discovered lands were already well known to the Indigenous peoples who had inhabited them for thousands of years.<!-- page 059 -->
The wars of conquest that took place to strip Indigenous peoples of their lands around the globe were not morally just wars; Indigenous peoples were not, as colonists often claimed, subhuman, and neither were they living in violation of any universally agreed-upon set of values.<!-- page 059 -->
There was no moral imperative to impose Christianity on the Indigenous peoples of the world.<!-- page 059 -->
They did not need to be ‘civilized’; indeed, there is no hierarchy of societies.<!-- page 059 -->
Indigenous peoples had systems that were complete unto themselves and met their needs.<!-- page 059 -->
Those systems were dynamic; they changed over time and were capable of continued change.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^74</a><!-- page 059 -->
Taken as a whole, the colonial process relied for its justification on the sheer presumption of taking a specific set of European beliefs and values and proclaiming them to be universal values that could be imposed upon the peoples of the world.<!-- page 059 -->
This universalizing of European values—so central to the colonial project—that was extended to North America served as the prime justification and rationale for the imposition of a residential school system on the Indigenous peoples of Canada.<!-- page 059 --></p>

<p>In Canada, residential schooling was closely linked to colonization and missionary crusades.<!-- page 059 -->
The first boarding school for Aboriginal people in what is now Canada was established in the early seventeenth century near the French trading post at the future site of Québec City.<!-- page 059 -->
At this Roman Catholic school, missionaries hoped to both ‘civilize’ and ‘Christianize’ young Aboriginal boys.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^75</a><!-- page 059 -->
The school was a failure: parents were reluctant to send their children, and the students were quick to run away and return home.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^76</a><!-- page 059 -->
Later efforts in New France met with no greater success.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^77</a><!-- page 059 -->
After the British conquest of New France in 1763, the idea of residential schooling lay dormant until the early nineteenth century.<!-- page 059 -->
In the first decade of that century, the New England Company, a British-based missionary society, funded a boarding school operation in Sussex Vale, New Brunswick.<!-- page 059 -->
The goals were to teach young Mi’kmaq and Maliseet children trades and to convert them to Protestantism.^[78]<!-- page 059 --><!-- page 060 -->
In the 1820s, John West, an Anglican missionary from England, opened a boarding school for Aboriginal students at Red River.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^79</a><!-- page 060 -->
Although these efforts also failed to take root, in 1834, the Mohawk Institute, a mission school on the Grand River in what is now Ontario, began taking in boarders.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^80</a><!-- page 060 -->
This school would remain in operation until 1970.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^81</a><!-- page 060 --></p>
<p><img alt="Kahkewaquonaby (Sacred Feathers), also known as Peter Jones, in 1832.

<p>In 1847, Egerton Ryerson, the superintendent of schools for Upper Canada, recommended the establishment of residential schools in which Aboriginal students would be given instruction in “English language, arithmetic, elementary geometry, or knowledge of forms, geography and the elements of general history, natural history and agricultural chemistry, writing, drawing and vocal music, bookkeeping (especially in reference to farmers’ accounts) religion and morals.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^82</a><!-- page 060 -->
This he thought of as “a plain English education adapted to the working farmer and mechanic. In this their object is identical with that of every good common school.” Pupils should be “taught agriculture, kitchen gardening, and mechanics, so far as mechanics is connected with making and repairing the most useful agricultural implements.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^83</a><!-- page 060 --></p>
<p>After the release of Ryerson’s report, Methodist missionaries operated a number of boarding schools in southern Ontario in the 1850s.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^84</a><!-- page 060 -->

<p>After the Canadian state was established in 1867, the federal government began making small per-student grants to many of the church-run boarding schools.<!-- page 060 -->
Federal government involvement in residential schooling did not begin in earnest until the 1880s.<!-- page 060 -->
The catalyst for this expansion was the 1870 transfer of much of contemporary Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, northern Québec, northern Ontario, the Northwest Territories, and Nunavut from the Hudson’s Bay Company to the Canadian government.<!-- page 060 --><!-- page 061 -->
The following year, British Columbia was brought into Confederation by the promise of a continental rail link.<!-- page 061 --></p>
<p>Canadian politicians intended to populate the newly acquired lands with settlers from Europe and Ontario.<!-- page 061 -->
These settlers were expected to buy goods produced in central Canada and ship their harvests by rail to western and eastern ports and then on to international markets.<!-- page 061 -->
Settling the “Northwest”—as this territory came to be known—in this manner meant colonizing the over 40,000 Indigenous people who lived there.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^88</a><!-- page 061 --></p>
<p>The Rupert’s Land Order of 1870, which transferred much of the Northwest to Canadian control, required that “the claims of the Indian tribes to compensation for lands required for purposes of settlement will be considered and settled in conformity with the equitable principles which have uniformly governed the British Crown in its dealings with the aborigines.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^89</a><!-- page 061 -->
These principles had been set down in the Royal Proclamation of 1763, which placed limits on the conditions under which Aboriginal land could be transferred.<!-- page 061 -->
“If at any Time any of the Said Indians should be inclined to dispose of the said Lands,” they could do so, but land could be sold only to the Crown, and the sale had to be at a meeting of Indians that had been held specifically for that purpose.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^90</a><!-- page 061 -->
The Royal Proclamation, in effect, ruled that any future transfer of ‘Indian’ land would take the form of a Treaty between sovereigns.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^91</a><!-- page 061 -->
In this, it stands as one of the clearest and earliest expressions of what has been identified as a long-standing element of Canadian Aboriginal policy.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^92</a><!-- page 061 --></p>
<p>To enable the colonization of the Northwest, in 1871, the federal government began negotiating the first in a series of what came to be termed as “Numbered Treaties” with the First Nations of western and northern Canada.<!-- page 061 -->
The only alternative to negotiating Treaties would have been to ignore the legal obligations of the Rupert’s Land Order and attempt to subdue the First Nations militarily, but that would have been a very costly proposition.<!-- page 061 -->
In 1870, when the entire Canadian government budget was $19 million, the United States was spending more than that—$20 million a year—on its Indian Wars alone.<!-- page 061 -->
Despite all these pressures, the government took a slow and piecemeal approach to Treaty making.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^93</a><!-- page 061 --></p>
<p>Through the Treaties, Aboriginal peoples were seeking agricultural supplies and training as well as relief during periods of epidemic or famine in a time of social and economic transition.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^94</a><!-- page 061 -->
They saw the Treaty process as establishing a reciprocal relationship that would be lasting.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^95</a><!-- page 061 -->
The goal was to gain the skills that would allow them to continue to control their own destinies and retain their culture and identity as Aboriginal people.<!-- page 061 -->
As Ahtahkakoop (Star Blanket) said, “We Indians can learn the ways of living that made the white man strong.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^96</a><!-- page 061 -->
The provisions varied from Treaty to Treaty, but they generally included funds for hunting and fishing supplies, agricultural assistance, yearly payments for band members (annuities), and an amount of reserve lands based on the population of the band.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^97</a><!-- page 061 -->
First Nations never asked for residential schools as part of the Treaty process, and neither did the government suggest that such schools would be established.<!-- page 061 -->
The education provisions also varied in different Treaties, but promised to pay for schools on reserves or teachers.<!-- page 061 --><!-- page 062 -->
The federal government was slow to live up to its Treaty obligations.<!-- page 062 -->
For example, many First Nations were settled on reserves that were much smaller than they were entitled to, while others were not provided with any reserve.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^98</a><!-- page 062 -->
Some obligations remain unfulfilled to this day.<!-- page 062 -->
The commitment to establish on-reserve schools was also ignored in many cases.<!-- page 062 -->
As a result, parents who wished to see their children educated were forced to send them to residential schools.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^99</a><!-- page 062 --></p>

</section></section><section class="section2" id="the-assimilation-policy"><h2><a class="toclink" href="#the-assimilation-policy">The assimilation policy<!-- page 063 --></a></h2>
<p>From the Canadian government’s perspective, the most significant elements in the Treaties were the written provisions by which the First Nations agreed to “cede, release, surrender, and yield” their land to the Crown.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^100</a><!-- page 063 -->
In the Treaty negotiations, however, federal officials left the impression that the government intended the Treaties to establish a permanent relationship with First Nations.<!-- page 063 -->
Treaty Commissioner Alexander Morris told the Cree in 1876, “What I trust and hope we will do is not for to-day and tomorrow only; what I will promise, and what I believe and hope you will take, is to last as long as the sun shines and yonder river flows.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^101</a><!-- page 063 -->
In reality, the federal government policy was very different from what Morris said.<!-- page 063 -->
The intent of the government’s policy, which was firmly established in legislation at the time that the Treaties had been negotiated, was to assimilate Aboriginal people into broader Canadian society.<!-- page 063 -->
At the end of this process, Aboriginal people were expected to have ceased to exist as a distinct people with their own governments, cultures, and identities.<!-- page 063 --></p>
<p>The federal <em>Indian Act</em>, first adopted in 1876, like earlier pre-Confederation legislation, defined who was and who was not an ‘Indian’ under Canadian law.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^102</a><!-- page 063 -->
The Act also defined a process through which a person could lose status as an Indian.<!-- page 063 -->
Women, for example, could lose status simply by marrying a man who did not have status.<!-- page 063 -->
Men could lose status in a number of ways, including graduating from a university.<!-- page 063 -->
Upon giving up their status, individuals also were granted a portion of the band’s reserve land.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^103</a><!-- page 063 --></p>
<p>First Nations people were unwilling to surrender their Aboriginal identity in this manner.<!-- page 063 -->
Until 1920, other than women who involuntarily lost their Indian status upon marriage to a non-status individual, only 250 ‘Indians’ voluntarily gave up their status.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^104</a><!-- page 063 -->
In 1920, the federal government amended the <em>Indian Act</em> to give it the power to strip individuals of their status against their will.<!-- page 063 -->
In explaining the purpose of the amendment to a parliamentary committee, Indian Affairs Deputy Minister Duncan Campbell Scott said that “our object is to continue until there is not a single Indian in Canada that has not been absorbed into the body politic, and there is no Indian question, and no Indian Department that is the whole object of this Bill.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^105</a><!-- page 063 -->
The other major element in the bill that Scott was referring to empowered the government to compel parents to send their children to residential schools.<!-- page 063 -->
Residential schooling was always more than simply an educational program: it was an integral part of a conscious policy of cultural genocide.<!-- page 063 --></p>
<p>Further evidence of this assault on Aboriginal identity can be found in amendments to the <em>Indian Act</em> banning a variety of Aboriginal cultural and spiritual practices.<!-- page 063 -->
The two most prominent of these were the west-coast Potlatch and the Prairie Thirst Dance (often referred to as the “Sun Dance”).<a href="footnote-placeholder">^106</a><!-- page 063 -->
Residential school principals had been in the forefront of the campaign to ban these ceremonies, and also urged the government to enforce the bans once they were put in place.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^107</a><!-- page 063 --></p>
<p><img alt="This “Sun Dance” ceremony was one of the Aboriginal spiritual practices outlawed by the federal government in the nineteenth century. Library and Archives Canada, Trueman, C-0104106." src="image-autofix/page-064.jpg" /><!-- page 064 --></p>
<p>The Aboriginal right to self-government was also undermined.<!-- page 064 -->
The <em>Indian Act</em> gave the federal government the authority to veto decisions made by band councils and to depose chiefs and councillors.<!-- page 064 -->
The Act placed restrictions on First Nations farmers’ ability to sell their crops and take out loans.<!-- page 064 -->
Over the years, the government also assumed greater authority as to how reserve land could be disposed of: in some cases, entire reserves were relocated against the will of the residents.<!-- page 064 -->
The <em>Indian Act</em> was a piece of colonial legislation by which, in the name of ‘protection,’ one group of people ruled and controlled another.<!-- page 064 --></p>
<section class="section3" id="the-industrial-school-initiative"><h3><a class="toclink" href="#the-industrial-school-initiative">The industrial school initiative<!-- page 064 --></a></h3>
<p>It was in keeping with this intent to assimilate Aboriginal peoples and, in the process, to eliminate its government-to-government relationship with First Nations that the federal government dramatically increased its involvement in residential schooling in the 1880s.<!-- page 064 -->
In December 1878, J. S. Dennis, the deputy minister of the Department of the Interior, prepared a memorandum for Prime Minister Sir John A.<!-- page 064 -->
Macdonald on the country’s Aboriginal policy.<!-- page 064 --><!-- page 065 -->
Dennis advised Macdonald that the long-term goal should be to instruct “our Indian and half-breed populations” in farming, raising cattle, and the mechanical trades, rendering them self-sufficient.<!-- page 065 -->
This would pave the way “for their emancipation from tribal government, and for their final absorption into the general community.”<!-- page 065 -->
Dennis argued that residential schools were key to fulfilling these goals.<!-- page 065 -->
It was his opinion that in a short time, schools might become “self-sustaining institutions.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^108</a><!-- page 065 --></p>
<p>In the following year, Nicholas Davin, a failed Conservative candidate, carried out a brief study of the boarding schools that the United States government had established for Native Americans.<!-- page 065 -->
He recommended that Canada establish a series of such schools on the Prairies.<!-- page 065 -->
Davin acknowledged that a central element of the education provided at these schools would be directed towards the destruction of Aboriginal spirituality.<!-- page 065 -->
Since all civilizations were based on religion, it would be inexcusable, he thought, to do away with Aboriginal faith “without supplying a better [one].”<!-- page 065 -->
For this reason, he recommended that while the government should fund the schools, the churches should operate them.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^109</a><!-- page 065 --></p>
<p>The decision to continue to rely on the churches to administer the schools on a day-today basis had serious consequences.<!-- page 065 -->
The government constantly struggled, and failed, to assert control over the churches’ drive to increase the number of schools they operated.<!-- page 065 -->
At various times, each denomination involved in school operation established boarding schools without government support or approval, and then lobbied later for per capita funding.<!-- page 065 -->
When the churches concluded, quite legitimately, that the per capita grant they received was too low, they sought other types of increases in school funding.<!-- page 065 -->
Building on their network of missions in the Northwest, the Catholics quickly came to dominate the field, usually operating twice as many schools as did the Protestant denominations.<!-- page 065 -->
Among the Protestant churches, the Anglicans were predominant, establishing and maintaining more residential schools than the Methodists or the Presbyterians.<!-- page 065 -->
The United Church, created by a union of Methodist and Presbyterian congregations, took over most of the Methodist and Presbyterian schools in the mid-1920s.<!-- page 065 -->
Presbyterian congregations that did not participate in the union established the Presbyterian Church in Canada and retained responsibility for two residential schools.<!-- page 065 -->
In addition to these national denominations, a local Baptist mission ran a residence for Aboriginal students in Whitehorse in the 1940s and 1950s, and a Mennonite ministry operated three schools in northwestern Ontario in the 1970s and 1980s.<!-- page 065 -->
Each faith, in its turn, claimed government discrimination against it.<!-- page 065 -->
Competition for converts meant that churches sought to establish schools in the same locations as their rivals, leading to internal divisions within communities and expensive duplication of services.<!-- page 065 --></p>
<p>The model for these residential schools for Aboriginal children, both in Canada and the United States, did not come from the private boarding schools to which members of the economic elites in Britain and Canada sent their children.<!-- page 065 -->
Instead, the model came from the reformatories and industrial schools that were being constructed in Europe and North America for the children of the urban poor.<!-- page 065 -->
The British parliament adopted the <em>Reformatory Schools Act</em> in 1854 and the <em>Industrial Schools Act</em> in 1857.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^110</a><!-- page 065 --><!-- page 066 -->
By 1882, over 17,000 children were in Britain’s industrial schools.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^111</a><!-- page 066 -->
Under Ontario’s 1880 <em>Act for the Protection and Reformation of Neglected Children</em>, a judge could send children under the age of fourteen to an industrial school, where they might be required to stay until they turned eighteen.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^112</a><!-- page 066 -->
Such schools could be dangerous and violent places.<!-- page 066 -->
At the Halifax Boys Industrial School, first offenders were strapped, and repeat offenders were placed in cells on a bread-and-water ration.<!-- page 066 -->
From there, they might be sent to the penitentiary.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^113</a><!-- page 066 -->
The Canadian government also drew inspiration from the United States.<!-- page 066 -->
There, the first in a series of large-scale, government-operated, boarding schools for Native Americans opened in 1879 in a former army barracks in Carlisle, Pennsylvania.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^114</a><!-- page 066 --></p>
<p><img alt="The Qu’Appelle school at Lebret in what is now Saskatchewan opened in 1884. O.B. Buell, Library and Archives Canada, PA-182246." src="image-autofix/page-066.jpg" /><!-- page 066 --></p>
<p>On the basis of Davin’s report and developments in the United States, the federal government decided to open three industrial schools.<!-- page 066 -->
The first one opened in Battleford in what is now Saskatchewan in 1883.<!-- page 066 -->
It was placed under the administration of an Anglican minister.<!-- page 066 -->
The following year, two more industrial schools opened: one at Qu’Appelle in what is now Saskatchewan, and one at High River in what is now Alberta.<!-- page 066 -->
Both these schools were administered by principals nominated by the Roman Catholic Oblate order.<!-- page 066 -->
The federal government not only built these schools, but it also assumed all the costs of operating them.<!-- page 066 -->
Recruiting students for these schools was difficult.<!-- page 066 -->
According to the Indian Affairs annual report, in 1884, there were only twenty-seven students at the three schools.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^115</a><!-- page 066 --></p>
<p>Unlike the church-run boarding schools, which provided a limited education with a heavy emphasis on religious instruction, the industrial schools were intended to prepare First Nations people for integration into Canadian society by teaching them basic trades, particularly farming.<!-- page 067 -->
Generally, industrial schools were larger than boarding schools, were located in urban areas, and, although church-managed, usually required federal approval prior to construction.<!-- page 067 -->
The boarding schools were smaller institutions, were located on or near reserves, and provided a more limited education.<!-- page 067 -->
The differences between the industrial schools and the boarding schools eroded over time.<!-- page 067 -->
By the 1920s, the federal government ceased to make any distinction between them, referring to them simply as “residential schools.”<!-- page 067 --></p>
<p>In justifying the investment in industrial schools to Parliament in 1883, Public Works Minister Hector Langevin argued that<!-- page 067 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>if you wish to educate these children you must separate them from their parents during the time that they are being educated.<!-- page 067 -->
If you leave them in the family they may know how to read and write, but they still remain savages, whereas by separating them in the way proposed, they acquire the habits and tastes—it is to be hoped only the good tastes—of civilized people.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^116</a><!-- page 067 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The federal government entered into residential schooling at a time when it was colonizing Aboriginal lands in western Canada.<!-- page 067 -->
It recognized that, through the Treaties, it had made commitments to provide Aboriginal people with relief in periods of economic distress.<!-- page 067 -->
It also feared that as traditional Aboriginal economic pursuits were marginalized or eliminated by settlers, the government might be called upon to provide increased relief.<!-- page 067 -->
In this context, the federal government chose to invest in residential schooling for a number of reasons.<!-- page 067 -->
First, it would provide Aboriginal people with skills that would allow them to participate in the coming market-based economy.<!-- page 067 -->
Second, it would further their political assimilation.<!-- page 067 -->
It was hoped that students who were educated in residential schools would give up their status and not return to their reserve communities and families.<!-- page 067 -->
Third, the schools were seen as engines of cultural and spiritual change: ‘savages’ were to emerge as Christian ‘white men.’ There was also a national security element to the schools.<!-- page 067 -->
Indian Affairs official Andsell Macrae observed that “it is unlikely that any Tribe or Tribes would give trouble of a serious nature to the Government whose members had children completely under Government control.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^117</a><!-- page 067 -->
Duncan Campbell Scott succinctly summarized Indian Affairs’ goals for the schools in 1909: “It includes not only a scholastic education, but instruction in the means of gaining a livelihood from the soil or as a member of an industrial or mercantile community, and the substitution of Christian ideals of conduct and morals for aboriginal concepts of both.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^118</a><!-- page 067 -->
The achievement of such invasive and ambitious goals would require a substantial level of funding.<!-- page 067 -->
This was never forthcoming.<!-- page 067 --></p>

<p>In announcing the construction of the three initial industrial schools, Indian Commissioner Edgar Dewdney said that although the starting costs would be high, he could see no reason why the schools would not be largely self-supporting in a few years, due to the skills in farming, raising stock, and trades that were being taught to the students.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^119</a><!-- page 068 -->
In supporting an Anglican proposal for two industrial schools in Manitoba, Indian Affairs Deputy Minister Lawrence Vankoughnet wrote to Prime Minister Macdonald that it would be “well to give a Grant of money annually to each school established by any Denomination for the industrial training of Indian children.”<!-- page 068 -->
He said that system worked well in Ontario, and it “costs the Government less than the whole maintenance of the School would cost and it enlists the sympathies and assistance of the religious denominations in the education and industrial training of the Indian children.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^120</a><!-- page 068 --></p>
<p>The government believed that between the forced labour of students and the poorly paid labour of missionaries, it could operate a residential school system on a nearly costfree basis.<!-- page 068 -->
The missionaries and the students were indeed a source of cheap labour—but the government was never happy with the quality of the teaching and, no matter how hard students worked, their labour never made the schools self-supporting.<!-- page 068 -->
Soon after the government established the industrial schools, it began to cut salaries.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^121</a><!-- page 068 -->
Initially, the federal government covered all the costs of operating the industrial schools.<!-- page 068 -->
In 1891, this policy was abandoned in favour of one by which schools received a fixed amount per student (referred to as a “per capita grant”).<a href="footnote-placeholder">^122</a><!-- page 068 -->
The system both intensified the level of competition among churches for students and encouraged principals to accept students who should have been barred from admission because they were too young or too sick.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^123</a><!-- page 068 --></p>
<p>The government never adequately responded to the belated discovery that the type of residential school system that officials had envisioned would cost far more than politicians were prepared to fund.<!-- page 068 -->
In the early twentieth century, chronic underfunding led to a health crisis in the schools and a financial crisis for the missionary societies.<!-- page 068 -->
Indian Affairs, with the support of leading figures in the Protestant churches, sought to dramatically reduce the number of residential schools, replacing them with day schools.<!-- page 068 -->
The government abandoned the plan when it failed to receive the full support of all the churches involved in the operation of the schools.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^124</a><!-- page 068 -->
Instead, in 1911, the federal government finally implemented a significant increase to the per capita grant received by boarding schools and attempted to impose basic health standards for the schools.<!-- page 068 -->
This resulted in a shortterm improvement.<!-- page 068 -->
However, inflation eroded the value of the grant increase, and the grant was actually reduced repeatedly during the Great Depression and at the start of the Second World War.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^125</a><!-- page 068 --></p>
<p>Funding for residential schools was always lower than funding for comparable institutions in Canada and the United States that served the general population.<!-- page 068 -->
In 1937, Indian Affairs was paying, on average, $180 a year per student.<!-- page 068 -->
This was less than a third of the per capita costs at that time for the Manitoba School for the Deaf ($642.40) and the Manitoba School for Boys ($550).<!-- page 068 --><!-- page 069 -->
In the United States, the annual per capita cost at the Chilocco Indian Residential School in Oklahoma in 1937 was $350.<!-- page 069 -->
According to the American Child Welfare League, the per capita costs for well-run institutions in that country ranged between $313 and $541.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^126</a><!-- page 069 -->
It would not be until the 1950s that changes were made in the funding system in Canada that were intended to ensure that the schools could recruit qualified teachers and improve the student diets.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^127</a><!-- page 069 -->
Even these improvements did not end the inequity in residential school funding.<!-- page 069 -->
In 1966, residential schools in Saskatchewan were spending between $694 and $1,193 a year per student.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^128</a><!-- page 069 -->
Comparable child-welfare institutions in Canada were spending between $3,300 and $9,855 a year.<!-- page 069 -->
In the United States, the annual cost of residential care per child was between $4,500 and $14,059.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^129</a><!-- page 069 --></p>
</section><section class="section2" id="compelling-attendance"><h2><a class="toclink" href="#compelling-attendance">Compelling attendance<!-- page 069 --></a></h2>
<p>It was not until 1894 that the federal government put in place regulations relating to residential school attendance.<!-- page 069 -->
Under the regulations adopted in that year, residential school attendance was voluntary.<!-- page 069 -->
However, if an Indian agent or justice of the peace thought that any “Indian child between six and sixteen years of age is not being properly cared for or educated, and that the parent, guardian or other person having charge or control of such child, is unfit or unwilling to provide for the child’s education,” he could issue an order to place the child “in an industrial or boarding school, in which there may be a vacancy for such child.”<!-- page 069 --></p>
<p>If a child placed in the school under these regulations left a residential school without permission, or did not return at a promised time, school officials could get a warrant from an Indian agent or a justice of the peace authorizing them (or a police officer, truant officer, or employee of the school or Indian Affairs) to “search for and take such child back to the school in which it had been previously placed.”<!-- page 069 -->
With a warrant, one could enter— by force if need be—any house, building, or place named in the warrant and remove the child.<!-- page 069 -->
Even without a warrant, Indian Affairs employees and constables had the authority to arrest a student in the act of escaping from a residential school and return the child to the school.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^130</a><!-- page 069 --></p>
<p>It was departmental policy that no child could be discharged without departmental approval—even if the parents had enrolled the child voluntarily.<!-- page 069 -->
The government had no legislative basis for this policy.<!-- page 069 -->
Instead, it relied on the admission form that parents were supposed to sign.<!-- page 069 -->
(In some cases, school staff members signed these forms.)<a href="footnote-placeholder">^131</a><!-- page 069 -->
By 1892, the department required that all parents sign an admission form when they enrolled their children in a residential school.<!-- page 069 -->
In signing the form, parents gave their consent that “the Principal or head teacher of the Institution for the time being shall be the guardian” of the child.<!-- page 069 -->
In that year, the Department of Justice provided Indian Affairs with a legal opinion to the effect that “the fact of a parent having signed such an application is not sufficient to warrant the forcible arrest against the parents’ will of a truant child who has been admitted to an Industrial School pursuant to the application.”<!-- page 069 --><!-- page 070 -->
It was held that, without legislative authority, no form could provide school administrators with the power of arrest.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^132</a><!-- page 070 -->
Despite this warning, well into the twentieth century, Indian Affairs would continue to enforce policies regarding attendance for which it had no legal authority.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^133</a><!-- page 070 -->
This is not the only example of the government’s use of unauthorized measures.<!-- page 070 -->
In the 1920s, students were to be discharged from residential school when they turned sixteen.<!-- page 070 -->
Despite this, William Graham, the Indian commissioner, refused to authorize discharge until the students turned eighteen.<!-- page 070 -->
He estimated that, on this basis, he rejected approximately 100 applications for discharge a year.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^134</a><!-- page 070 --></p>

<p>In 1920, the <em>Indian Act</em> was amended to allow the government to compel any First Nations child to attend residential school.<!-- page 070 -->
However, residential school was never compulsory for all First Nations children.<!-- page 070 -->
In most years, there were more First Nations children attending Indian Affairs day schools than residential schools.<!-- page 070 -->
During the early 1940s, this pattern was reversed.<!-- page 070 -->
In the 1944–45 school year, there were 8,865 students in residential schools, and 7,573 students in Indian Affairs day schools.<!-- page 070 -->
In that year, there were reportedly 28,429 school-aged Aboriginal children.<!-- page 070 --><!-- page 071 -->
This meant that 31.1% of the schoolaged Aboriginal children were in residential school.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^135</a><!-- page 071 --></p>

<section class="section3" id="regulation"><h3><a class="toclink" href="#regulation">Regulation<!-- page 071 --></a></h3>
<p>The residential school system operated with few regulations; those that did exist were in large measure weakly enforced.<!-- page 071 -->
The Canadian government never developed anything approaching the education acts and regulations by which provincial governments administered public schools.<!-- page 071 -->
The key piece of legislation used in regulating the residential school system was the <em>Indian Act</em>.<!-- page 071 -->
This was a multi-purpose piece of legislation that defined and limited First Nations life in Canada.<!-- page 071 -->
The Act contained no education-related provisions until 1884.<!-- page 071 -->
There were no residential school–specific regulations until 1894.<!-- page 071 -->
These dealt almost solely with attendance and truancy.<!-- page 071 --></p>
<p>It was recognized by those who worked within the system that the level of regulation was inadequate.<!-- page 071 -->
In 1897, Indian Affairs education official Martin Benson wrote, “No regulations have been adopted or issued by the Department applicable to all its schools, as had been done by the Provincial Governments.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^136</a><!-- page 071 -->
The situation did not improve over time.<!-- page 071 -->
The education section of the 1951 <em>Indian Act</em> and the residential school regulations adopted in 1953 were each only four pages in length.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^137</a><!-- page 071 -->
By comparison, the Manitoba <em>Public Schools Act</em> of 1954 was ninety-one pages in length.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^138</a><!-- page 071 -->
In addition to the Act, the Manitoba government had adopted nineteen education-related regulations.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^139</a><!-- page 071 --></p>
<p>It is also apparent that many key people within the system had little knowledge of the existing rules and regulations.<!-- page 072 -->
In 1922, an Indian agent in Hagersville, Ontario, inquired of departmental headquarters if there had been any changes in the regulations regarding education since the adoption of a set of education regulations in 1908.<!-- page 072 -->
His question suggests he was completely unaware of major changes to the <em>Indian Act</em> regarding education that had supplanted previous regulations in 1920.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^140</a><!-- page 072 -->
In 1926, J. K. Irwin, the newly appointed principal of the Gordon’s school in Saskatchewan, discovered upon taking office that he could not find any “laid down regulations as to the duties and powers of a Principal of an Indian Boarding School.”<!-- page 072 -->
He wrote to Indian Affairs, asking for a copy of such regulations, since he wanted to know “exactly what I am to do and what powers I have.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^141</a><!-- page 072 -->
Departmental secretary J. D. McLean informed him that “there are no printed regulations concerning the duties and powers of the principal of an Indian residential school.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^142</a><!-- page 072 --></p>
<p>The system was so unregulated that in 1968, after Canada had been funding residential schools for 101 years, Indian Affairs Deputy Minister J. A. MacDonald announced, “For the first time we have set down in a precise and detailed manner the criteria which is to be used in future in determining whether or not an Indian child is eligible for these institutions.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^143</a><!-- page 072 --></p>

<p>From the 1880s onwards, residential school enrolment climbed annually.<!-- page 072 -->
According to federal government annual reports, the peak enrolment of 11,539 was reached in the 1956–57 school year.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^144</a><!-- page 072 -->
(For trends, see Graph 1.)<!-- page 072 -->
Most of the residential schools were located in the northern and western regions of the country.<!-- page 072 -->
With the exception of Mount Elgin and the Mohawk Institute, the Ontario schools were all in northern or northwestern Ontario.<!-- page 072 -->
The only school in the Maritimes did not open until 1930.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^145</a><!-- page 072 -->
Roman Catholic and Anglican missionaries opened the first two schools in Québec in the early 1930s.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^146</a><!-- page 072 -->
It was not until later in that decade that the federal government began funding these schools.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^147</a><!-- page 072 --></p>
<p>The number of schools began to decline in the 1940s.<!-- page 072 -->
Between 1940 and 1950, for example, ten school buildings were destroyed by fire.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^148</a><!-- page 072 -->
As Graph 2 illustrates, this decrease was reversed in the mid-1950s, when the federal department of Northern Affairs and National Resources dramatically expanded the school system in the Northwest Territories and northern Québec.<!-- page 072 -->
Prior to that time, residential schooling in the North was largely restricted to the Yukon and the Mackenzie Valley in the Northwest Territories.<!-- page 072 -->
Large residences were built in communities such as Inuvik, Yellowknife, Whitehorse, Churchill, and eventually Iqaluit (formerly Frobisher Bay).<!-- page 072 -->
This expansion was undertaken despite reports that recommended against the establishment of residential schools, since they would not provide children with the skills necessary to live in the North, skills they otherwise would have acquired in their home communities.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^149</a><!-- page 072 -->

<p>Many of the early advocates of residential schooling in Canada expected that the schools would take in both Aboriginal children who had status under the <em>Indian Act</em> (in other words, they were Indians as defined by the Act) as well as Aboriginal children who, for a variety of reasons, did not have status.<!-- page 074 -->
The federal government classed these individuals alternately as “non-status Indians,” “half-breeds,” or “Métis.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^150</a><!-- page 074 --></p>
<p>The early church-run boarding schools made no distinction between status and non-status or Métis children.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^151</a><!-- page 074 -->
The federal government position on the matter was constantly shifting.<!-- page 074 -->
It viewed the Métis as members of the ‘dangerous classes’ whom the residential schools were intended to civilize and assimilate.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^152</a><!-- page 074 -->
This view led to the adoption of policies that allowed for the admission of Métis children to the schools at various times.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^153</a><!-- page 074 --><!-- page 075 -->
However, from a jurisdictional perspective, the federal government believed that the responsibility for educating and assimilating Métis people lay with provincial and territorial governments.<!-- page 075 -->
There was a strong concern that if the federal government began providing funding for the education of some of the children the provinces and territories were responsible for, it would find itself subject to having to take responsibility for the rest.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^154</a><!-- page 075 -->
When this view dominated, Indian agents would be instructed to remove Métis students from residential schools.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^155</a><!-- page 075 --></p>
<p><img alt="Métis children at the Dawson City, Yukon, residence. General Synod Archives, Anglican Church of Canada, P75-103-S8-264." src="image-autofix/page-075.jpg" /><!-- page 075 --></p>
<p>Despite their perceived constitutional responsibility, provincial and territorial governments were reluctant to provide services to Métis people.<!-- page 075 -->
They did not ensure that there were schools in Métis communities, or work to see that Métis children were admitted and welcomed into the general public school system.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^156</a><!-- page 075 -->
Many Métis parents who wished to see their children educated in schools had no option but to try to have them accepted into a residential school.<!-- page 075 -->
In some cases, these would be federally funded schools, but, in other cases, Métis students attended church-run schools or residences that did not receive federal funding.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^157</a><!-- page 075 --></p>
<p>Provincial governments slowly began to provide increased educational services to Métis students after the Second World War.<!-- page 075 -->
As a result, Métis children lived in residences and residential schools that were either run or funded by provincial governments.<!-- page 075 -->
The Métis experience is an important reminder that the impacts of residential schooling extend beyond the formal residential school program that Indian Affairs operated.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^158</a><!-- page 075 --></p>
<p><img alt="Inuit children were recruited to a school in Shingle Point in the Yukon in the 1920s. General Synod Archives, Anglican Church of Canada, P9901-589." src="image-autofix/page-076.jpg" /><!-- page 076 --></p>
<p>Prior to the 1950s, most of the students who attended schools in the Northwest Territories were either First Nations or Métis.<!-- page 076 -->
As late as 1949, only 111 Inuit students were receiving full-time schooling in the North.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^159</a><!-- page 076 -->
The hostel system that Northern Affairs established in the Northwest Territories in the mid-1950s did not restrict admission to First Nations students.<!-- page 076 -->
It was only at this point that large numbers of Inuit children began attending residential schools.<!-- page 076 -->
The impact of the schools on the Inuit was complex.<!-- page 076 -->
Some children were sent to schools thousands of kilometres from their homes, and went years without seeing their parents.<!-- page 076 -->
In other cases, parents who had previously been supporting themselves by following a seasonal cycle of land- and marine-based resource harvesting began settling in communities with hostels so as not to be separated from their children.<!-- page 076 --></p>
<p>Because of the majority of the Aboriginal population in two of the three northern territories, the per capita impact of the schools in the North is higher than anywhere else in the country.<!-- page 076 -->
And, because the history of these schools is so recent, not only are there many living Survivors today, but there are also many living parents of Survivors.<!-- page 076 -->
For these reasons, both the intergenerational impacts and the legacy of the schools, the good and the bad, are particularly strongly felt in the North.<!-- page 076 --></p>

<p>By 1945, the Indian Affairs residential school system, starved for funding for fifteen years, was on the verge of collapse.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^160</a><!-- page 077 -->
Not only was the existing Indian Affairs education system lacking money and resources, but also there were no school facilities of any sort for 42% of the school-aged First Nations children.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^161</a><!-- page 077 -->
Having concluded that it was far too expensive to provide residential schooling to these students, Indian Affairs began to look for alternatives.<!-- page 077 -->
One was to expand the number of Indian Affairs day schools.<!-- page 077 -->
From 1945– 46 to 1954–55, the number of First Nations students in Indian Affairs day schools increased from 9,532 to 17,947.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^162</a><!-- page 077 -->
In 1949, the Special Joint Committee of the Senate and House of Commons Appointed to Examine and Consider The <em>Indian Act</em> recommended “that wherever and whenever possible Indian children should be educated in association with other children.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^163</a><!-- page 077 -->
In 1951, the <em>Indian Act</em> was amended to allow the federal government to enter into agreements with provincial governments and school boards to have First Nations students educated in public schools.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^164</a><!-- page 077 -->
By 1960, the number of students attending “non-Indian” schools (9,479) had surpassed the number living in residential schools (9,471).<a href="footnote-placeholder">^165</a><!-- page 077 -->
The transfer of First Nations students into the public school system was described as “integration.”<!-- page 077 -->
By then, the overall policy goal was to restrict the education being given in Indian Affairs schools to the lower grades.<!-- page 077 -->
Therefore, it was expected that during the course of their schooling, at least half of the students then in Indian Affairs schools would transfer to a ‘non-Indian’ school.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^166</a><!-- page 077 --></p>
<p>The integration policy was opposed by some of the church organizations.<!-- page 077 -->
Roman Catholic church officials argued that residential schooling was preferable for three reasons: 1) teachers in public schools were not prepared to deal with Aboriginal students; 2) students in public schools often expressed racist attitudes towards Aboriginal students; and 3) Aboriginal students felt acute embarrassment over their impoverished conditions, particularly in terms of the quality of the clothing they wore and the food they ate.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^167</a><!-- page 077 -->

<p>From the 1940s onwards, residential schools increasingly served as orphanages and child-welfare facilities.<!-- page 077 -->
By 1960, the federal government estimated that 50% of the children in residential schools were there for child-welfare reasons.<!-- page 077 -->
What has come to be referred to as the “Sixties Scoop”—the dramatic increase in the apprehension of Aboriginal children from the 1960s onwards—was in some measure simply a transferring of children from one form of institution, the residential school, to another, the child-welfare agency.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^169</a><!-- page 077 -->
The schools were not funded or staffed to function as child-welfare institutions.<!-- page 077 -->
They failed to provide their students with the appropriate level of personal and emotional care children need during their childhood and adolescence.<!-- page 077 --><!-- page 078 -->
This failure applied to all students, but was of particular significance in the case of the growing number of social-welfare placements in the schools.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^170</a><!-- page 078 -->
Some children had to stay in the schools year-round because it was thought there was no safe home to which they could return.<!-- page 078 -->
The residential school environment was not a safer or more loving haven.<!-- page 078 -->
These children spent their entire childhoods in an institution.<!-- page 078 --></p>
<p>The closure of residential schools, which commenced in earnest in 1970, was accompanied by a significant increase in the number of children being taken into care by child-welfare agencies.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^171</a><!-- page 078 -->
By the end of the 1970s, the transfer of children from residential schools was nearly complete in southern Canada, and the impact of the Sixties Scoop was in evidence across the country.<!-- page 078 -->

<p>In 1968, the federal government drastically restructured the residential school system by dividing the schools into residences and day schools, each with a principal or administrator.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^174</a><!-- page 078 -->
In June of the following year, the federal government took direct control over all the schools in southern Canada.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^175</a><!-- page 078 -->
Because churches were allowed to continue to appoint the residence administrators, their presence continued in many schools in the coming years.<!-- page 078 -->
They were, however, no longer directly responsible for the facilities.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^176</a><!-- page 078 -->
In 1969, the federal government also began to transfer the hostels and day schools in the Yukon and Northwest Territories to their respective territorial governments.<!-- page 078 -->
Most of the small hostels in the eastern Arctic and Nunavik (Arctic Québec) were closed by the end of 1971.<!-- page 078 -->
(Four small hostels were also operated in the western and central Arctic.<!-- page 078 -->

<p>Having assumed control over the southern Canadian schools in 1969, the federal government commenced what would prove to be a protracted process of closing the system down.<!-- page 078 -->
According to the Indian Affairs annual report for 1968–69, the department was responsible for sixty residences.<!-- page 078 -->
Two years later, the number was down to forty-five.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^178</a><!-- page 078 -->
The government takeover of the residential schools also coincided with the release of the federal government’s White Paper on “Indian Policy.”<!-- page 078 -->
This document proposed a massive transfer of responsibility for First Nations people from the federal to provincial governments.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^179</a><!-- page 078 -->
It called for the repeal of the <em>Indian Act</em>, the winding up of the Department of Indian Affairs, and the eventual extinguishment of the Treaties.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^180</a><!-- page 078 -->
The recently formed National Indian Brotherhood (nib) described the White Paper as a document intended to bring about “the destruction of a Nation of People by legislation and cultural genocide.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^181</a><!-- page 078 --></p>
<p>In its response, the nib proposed “Indian Control of Indian Education.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^182</a><!-- page 079 -->
In 1971, Indian Affairs Minister Jean Chrétien announced that, in the face of First Nations resistance, the federal government was abandoning the policy directions outlined in the White Paper.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^183</a><!-- page 079 --></p>
<p>By then, First Nations communities had already taken over one residential school.<!-- page 079 -->
In the summer of 1970, parents of children at the Blue Quills, Alberta, school occupied the school, demanding that its operation be turned over to a First Nations education authority.<!-- page 079 -->
They took this measure in response to reports that the school was to be turned into a residence and their children were to be educated at a nearby public school.<!-- page 079 -->
The Blue Quills conflict was the result of both long-standing local dissatisfaction with the administration of the school and First Nations opposition to the policy of integration.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^184</a><!-- page 079 -->
It was estimated that over 1,000 people participated in the sit-in, with rarely fewer than 200 people being at the school on any given day.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^185</a><!-- page 079 -->
Seventeen days after the sit-in commenced, Minister Jean Chrétien announced that the school would be transferred to the Blue Quills Native Education Council.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^186</a><!-- page 079 -->
In coming years, the Qu’Appelle, Prince Albert, Duck Lake, Lestock, and Grayson facilities in Saskatchewan were also taken over by First Nations authorities.<!-- page 079 -->
The Christie residence in Tofino, British Columbia, was also operated briefly by an Aboriginal authority.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^187</a><!-- page 079 --></p>
<p>The federal government, however, remained committed to the closing of the facilities.<!-- page 079 -->
Because of the government’s lengthy history of underfunding residential schools, many of the schools were in poor repair.<!-- page 079 -->
Between 1995 and 1998, the last seven residences in southern Canada were closed.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^188</a><!-- page 079 --></p>
<p>Starting in the 1970s, territorial governments, in which former residential school students were serving as cabinet ministers, also began expanding the number of day schools as part of a campaign to close residential schools in the North.<!-- page 079 -->
The last large hostel in the Yukon closed in 1985.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^189</a><!-- page 079 -->
By 1986, there were only three large hostels operating in the Northwest Territories.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^190</a><!-- page 079 -->
Grollier Hall, the last large hostel in the North, closed in 1997.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^191</a><!-- page 079 -->
If one dates the residential school system back to the early 1830s, when the Mohawk Institute first took in boarders, the system had been in operation for over 160 years.<!-- page 079 -->
The closing of the schools did not mark the end of the history of residential schooling in Canada.<!-- page 079 -->
By the 1990s, former students had begun to make Canadians aware of the tremendous harm that the residential school experience had caused to Aboriginal people and Aboriginal communities.<!-- page 079 --></p>

<p>As educational institutions, the residential schools were failures, and regularly judged as such.<!-- page 080 -->
In 1923, former Regina industrial school principal R. B. Heron delivered a paper to a meeting of the Regina Presbytery of the Presbyterian Church that was highly critical of the residential school system.<!-- page 080 -->
He said that parents generally were anxious to have their children educated, but they complained that their children “are not kept regularly in the class-room; that they are kept out at work that produces revenue for the School; that when they return to the Reserves they have not enough education to enable them to transact ordinary business—scarcely enough to enable them to write a legible letter.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^192</a><!-- page 080 -->
The schools’ success rate did not improve.<!-- page 080 -->
From 1940–41 to 1959–60, 41.3% of each year’s residential school Grade One enrolment was not promoted to Grade Two.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^193</a><!-- page 080 -->
Just over half of those who were in Grade Two would get to Grade Six.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^194</a><!-- page 080 --></p>
<p>Many principals and teachers had low expectations of their students.<!-- page 080 -->
Wikwemikong, Ontario, principal R. Baudin wrote in 1883, “What we may reasonably expect from the generality of children, is certainly not to make great scholars of them.<!-- page 080 --><!-- page 081 -->
Good and moral as they may be, they lack great mental capacity.”<!-- page 081 -->
He did not think it wise to expect them to “be equal in every respect to their white brethren.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^195</a><!-- page 081 -->
In preparing a 1928 report on the Anglican school at Onion Lake, a Saskatchewan government school inspector expressed his belief that “in arithmetic abstract ideas develop slowly in the Indian child.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^196</a><!-- page 081 -->
Some thought it was a risky matter to give the students too much education.<!-- page 081 -->
Mount Elgin principal S. R. McVitty wrote in 1928 that “classroom work is an important part of our training, but not by any means the most important.”<!-- page 081 -->
He added, “In the case of the Indian ‘a little learning is a dangerous thing.’”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^197</a><!-- page 081 --></p>
<p><img alt="Members of the Croissés, a religious society for youth at the Fort Frances, Ontario, school. St. Boniface Historical Society Archives, Fond of the Grey Nuns of Manitoba, 03/31/1." src="image-autofix/page-081.jpg" /><!-- page 081 --></p>
<p>Much of what went on in the classroom was simply repetitious drill.<!-- page 081 -->
A 1915 report on the Roman Catholic school on the Blood Reserve in Alberta noted, “The children’s work was merely memory work and did not appear to be developing any deductive power, altogether too parrot like and lacking expression.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^198</a><!-- page 081 -->
A 1932 inspector’s report from the Grayson, Saskatchewan, school suggests there had been little change.<!-- page 081 -->
“The teaching as I saw it today was merely a question of memorizing and repeating a mass of, to the children, ‘meaningless’ facts.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^199</a><!-- page 081 --></p>
<p>The classrooms were often severely overcrowded.<!-- page 081 -->
At the Qu’Appelle school in 1911, Sister McGurk had seventy-five girls in her junior classroom.<!-- page 081 -->
The inspector of Roman Catholic schools reported to Ottawa that this was an “almost impossible” situation.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^200</a><!-- page 081 -->
In 1915, two teachers were responsible for 120 students at the Coqualeetza Institute in Chilliwack, British Columbia.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^201</a><!-- page 081 -->
In 1928, there were sixty students in the junior classroom at the Alberni, British Columbia, school.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^202</a><!-- page 081 --></p>
<p>The Indian Affairs schools branch maintained that the principals and the staff were “appointed by the church authorities, subject to the approval of the Department as to qualifications.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^203</a><!-- page 082 -->
In reality, the churches hired staff and the government then automatically approved their selections.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^204</a><!-- page 082 -->
The churches placed a greater priority on religious commitment than on teaching ability.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^205</a><!-- page 082 -->
Because the pay was so low, many of the teachers lacked any qualification to teach.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^206</a><!-- page 082 -->
In 1908, Indian Affairs inspector F. H. Paget reported that at the Battleford school, “frequent changes in the staff at this school has not been to its advantage.”<!-- page 082 -->
The problem lay not with the principal, but with the fact that “more profitable employment is available in the District and, furthermore, the salaries paid are not as high as are paid in other public institutions.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^207</a><!-- page 082 -->
When a British Columbia Indian agent recommended that schools be required to hire only qualified staff, he was told by his superior, British Columbia Indian Superintendent A. W. Vowell, that such a requirement would result in the churches’ applying for “larger grants.”<!-- page 082 -->
And, as Vowell understood it, Indian Affairs “is not at present disposed to entertain requests for increased grants to Indian boarding and industrial schools.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^208</a><!-- page 082 -->
In 1955, 55 (23%) of the 241 teachers in residential schools directly employed by Indian Affairs had no teacher’s certificate.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^209</a><!-- page 082 -->
In 1969, Indian Affairs reported it was still paying its teachers less than they could make in provincial schools.<!-- page 082 -->
“As a result, there are about the same number of unqualified teachers, some 140, in federal schools [residential and non-residential] now, as ten years ago.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^210</a><!-- page 082 --></p>
<p>In the minds of some principals, religious training was the most valuable training the schools provided.<!-- page 082 -->
In 1903, Brandon, Manitoba, principal T.<!-- page 082 -->
Ferrier wrote that “while it is very important that the Indian child should be educated, it is of more importance that he should build up a good clean character.”<!-- page 082 -->
Such a heavy emphasis was required, in Ferrier’s opinion, to “counteract the evil tendencies of the Indian nature.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^211</a><!-- page 082 -->
Louise Moine recalled that religious instruction and observation were a constant part of life at the Qu’Appelle school in the early twentieth century: “From the time we got out of bed at the sound of the bell, we went down on our knees to pray.<!-- page 082 -->
After we had washed and dressed, we headed for the chapel to attend Low mass which was always held at 7 a.m.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^212</a><!-- page 082 -->
The staff handbook for the Presbyterian school in Kenora in the 1940s stated it was expected that, upon leaving the school, most students would “return to the Indian Reserves from which they had come.”<!-- page 082 -->
Given this future, staff members were told that “the best preparation we can give them is to teach them the Christian way of life.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^213</a><!-- page 082 --></p>
<p>Not surprisingly, many of those who succeeded academically followed careers in the church.<!-- page 082 -->
Coqualeetza graduate Peter Kelly became a Methodist Church minister.<!-- page 082 -->
Emmanuel College graduate Edward Ahenakew became an Anglican minister.<!-- page 082 -->
Others worked for government or taught school.<!-- page 082 -->
Qu’Appelle graduate Daniel Kennedy became an interpreter and general assistant for the Assiniboine Indian Agency.<!-- page 082 -->
Joseph Dion, a graduate of the Onion Lake school, taught school for many years in Saskatchewan.<!-- page 082 -->
Still others pursued business and professional careers.<!-- page 082 -->
After attending the Mohawk Institute, Beverly Johnson went to Hellmuth College in London, Ontario, where he excelled at sports and drama.<!-- page 082 -->
He then went to work for the New York Life Insurance Company in Pennsylvania.<!-- page 082 --><!-- page 083 -->
A graduate of the Mohawk Institute, N. E. Lickers, was called to the bar in 1938 and was described by the Branford Expositor as the “First Ontario Indian Lawyer.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^214</a><!-- page 083 --></p>
<p>Despite these successes, little encouragement generally was offered to students who wished to pursue further education.<!-- page 083 -->
Oliver Martin, who was raised on the Six Nations Reserve in Ontario and went on to become an Ontario magistrate, recalled being told by Indian Affairs Deputy Minister Duncan Campbell Scott: “It’s no use sending you Indians to school you just go back to the reserve anyway.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^215</a><!-- page 083 --></p>
<p>For many students, classroom life was foreign and traumatic.<!-- page 083 -->
David Charleson said he found the regimentation at the Christie, British Columbia, school so disturbing that he “never wanted to learn, so I jumped into my shell.<!-- page 083 -->
I took Kindergarten twice because of what happened to me.<!-- page 083 -->
I didn’t want to learn.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^216</a><!-- page 083 -->
At the Birtle school in Manitoba, Isabelle Whitford said, she had a hard time adjusting to the new language and the classroom discipline.<!-- page 083 -->
“Every time I couldn’t get an answer, like, you know, she would pull my ears and shake my head.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^217</a><!-- page 083 -->
Betsy Olson described class work at the Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, school as a torment, in which her “spelling was always 30, 40, it was way down.<!-- page 083 -->
And when we did spelling, sometimes I freeze, I couldn’t move, I just scribbled because I couldn’t move my hand.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^218</a><!-- page 083 -->
Leona Agawa never felt comfortable in the classroom at the Spanish, Ontario, school.<!-- page 083 -->
For much of her time in school, she was frightened or intimidated.<!-- page 083 -->
“I’d hear my name, but I never got to answer.<!-- page 083 -->
I stood up, never got to answer what they were saying when they sat me down.<!-- page 083 -->
And I’d get a good slap after, after you, you leave there for not being nice in school.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^219</a><!-- page 083 --></p>
<p>Since the 1920s, Indian Affairs had required residential schools to adopt provincial curricula.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^220</a><!-- page 083 -->
The department had also asked provincial governments to have their school inspectors inspect Indian Affairs schools.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^221</a><!-- page 083 -->
The wisdom of this practice had been questioned during the hearings of the Special Joint Committee of the Senate and House of Commons inquiry into the <em>Indian Act</em> in the 1940s.<!-- page 083 -->
Andrew Moore, a secondary school inspector for the Province of Manitoba, told the committee members that Indian Affairs took full responsibility for all aspects of First Nations education, including curriculum.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^222</a><!-- page 083 -->
Provincial education departments, including the one he worked for, were “not organized or not interested in Indian schools.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^223</a><!-- page 083 --></p>
<p>In 1963, D. W. Hepburn, the former principal of the federal school in Inuvik, published an article with the ominous headline “Northern Education: Façade for Failure.”<!-- page 083 -->
He argued that the education being provided in the new federal schools was “hopelessly inadequate.<!-- page 083 -->
The reasons for this failure are clear: the aims of education set forth by the Department are thoroughly confused, the curriculum is inappropriate, and many current practices of the system are not only ill-conceived but actually harmful.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^224</a><!-- page 083 -->
Although 60% of the students at the Inuvik school were in the first three grades, few teachers had any background in primary education, and “almost none has any special training in native education, and will receive none from the Department.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^225</a><!-- page 083 -->
The schools were producing individuals who “lack not only the skills required for most permanent wage employment but also those necessary for the traditional economy.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^226</a><!-- page 083 --><!-- page 084 --></p>
<p>The decision to leave curriculum to provincial education departments meant that Aboriginal students were subjected to an education that demeaned their history, ignored their current situation, and did not even recognize them or their families as citizens.<!-- page 084 -->
This was one of the reasons for the growing Aboriginal hostility to the Indian Affairs integration policy.<!-- page 084 -->
An examination of the treatment of Aboriginal people in provincially approved textbooks reveals a serious and deep-rooted problem.<!-- page 084 -->
In response to a 1956 recommendation that textbooks be developed that were relevant to Aboriginal students, Indian Affairs official R.<!-- page 084 -->
F.<!-- page 084 -->
Davey commented, “The preparation of school texts is an extremely difficult matter.”<!-- page 084 -->
It was his opinion that “there are other needs which can be met more easily and should be undertaken first.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^227</a><!-- page 084 -->
In the following years, assessments of public-school textbooks showed that they continued to perpetuate racist stereotypes of Aboriginal people.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^228</a><!-- page 084 -->
A 1968 survey pointed out that in some books, the word <em>squaw</em> was being used to describe Aboriginal women, and the word <em>redskins</em> used to describe Aboriginal people.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^229</a><!-- page 084 --></p>
<p>Students also noted that the curriculum belittled their ancestry.<!-- page 084 -->
Mary Courchene said, “Their only mandate was to Christianize and civilize; and it’s written in black and white.<!-- page 084 -->
And every single day we were reminded.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^230</a><!-- page 084 -->
Lorna Cochrane could never forget an illustration in a social studies text.<!-- page 084 -->
“There was a picture of two Jesuits laying in the snow, they were murdered by these two ‘savages.’ And they had this what we call ‘a blood-curdling look’ on their faces is how I remember that picture.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^231</a><!-- page 084 -->
When the curriculum was not racist, it was bewildering and alienating.<!-- page 084 -->
Many students could not identify with the content of the classroom materials.<!-- page 084 -->
For instance, Lillian Elias remembers that “when I looked at Dick and Jane I thought Dick and Jane were in heaven when I saw all the green grass.<!-- page 084 -->
That’s how much I knew about Dick and Jane.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^232</a><!-- page 084 --></p>
<p>Some students said that the limits of the education they had received in residential school became apparent when they were integrated into the public school system.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^233</a><!-- page 084 -->
Many said there was no expectation that they would succeed.<!-- page 084 -->
Walter Jones never forgot the answer that a fellow student at the Alberni, British Columbia, school was given when he asked if he would be able to go to Grade Twelve.<!-- page 084 -->
“That supervisor said, ‘You don’t need to go that far,’ he says.<!-- page 084 -->
He says, ‘Your people are never going to get education to be a professional worker, and it doesn’t matter what lawyer, or doctor, or electrician, or anything, that a person has to go to school for.’”234<!-- page 084 --></p>
<p>Some northern schools developed reputations for academic success.<!-- page 084 -->
Grandin College in Fort Smith was established originally to recruit young people for the Catholic ministry.<!-- page 084 -->
A new principal, Jean Pochat, decided to focus on providing young men and women with leadership training.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^235</a><!-- page 084 -->
The school became known as a “leadership factory,” producing numerous future government leaders for the North.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^236</a><!-- page 084 -->
Students who attended the Churchill Vocational Centre spoke about how they were taught by open-minded teachers who were willing to expose them to the social and political changes taking place across the world in the 1960s.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^237</a><!-- page 084 --><!-- page 085 -->
John Amagoalik wrote that at the Churchill Vocational Centre, “we had excellent teachers.<!-- page 085 -->
To this day we still talk about them…<!-- page 085 -->
They treated us as ordinary people.<!-- page 085 -->
We had never experienced this sort of attitude before and it was, in a way, liberating to be with new teachers that treated you as their equal.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^238</a><!-- page 085 -->
David Simailak spoke of how his time at residential school gave him a series of new opportunities.<!-- page 085 -->
He fondly remembers excelling at math and spelling competitions, and travelling to Montreal for Expo ’67.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^239</a><!-- page 085 --></p>
<p><img alt="Grandin College in Fort Smith, Northwest Territories, developed a positive reputation as a “leadership factory” for the North. Deschâtelets Archives." src="image-autofix/page-085.jpg" /><!-- page 085 --></p>
<p>Specific teachers were remembered with gratitude.<!-- page 085 -->
When Roddy Soosay lived in residence, he attended a local public school.<!-- page 085 -->
He credited his high school principal at the Ponoka, Alberta, public school for pushing him to succeed.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^240</a><!-- page 085 -->
Martha Loon said that at the Poplar Hill, Ontario, school in the 1980s, there were staff members who befriended and helped her and her siblings.<!-- page 085 -->
There was one staff member to whom she could tell all her problems.<!-- page 085 -->
“I could say anything to her, and we’d go for walks sometimes.<!-- page 085 -->
So, I could tell her anything and she wouldn’t, she wouldn’t say anything to other staff members about it.<!-- page 085 -->
So, in a way, that’s, you know, gave me a chance to express my frustrations, and the things that I didn’t like.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^241</a><!-- page 085 --></p>
<p>Other students were able to concentrate on their studies.<!-- page 085 -->
Frederick Ernest Koe said that at Stringer Hall in Inuvik, he devoted all his energies to his school work.<!-- page 085 -->
“You kind of develop a protective mechanism on the shell that you didn’t rat on anybody, you kind of behave, you followed orders and things would go smooth.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^242</a><!-- page 085 -->
Madeleine Dion Stout succeeded academically at the Blue Quills school, but she did not credit the school for her success.<!-- page 085 -->
“It’s not residential school that made me a good student.<!-- page 085 -->
My, the fundamental values and good example I had before I went to residential school by my grandfather and my parents, and all the old people on the reserve where I grew up are the ones who made me a good student.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^243</a><!-- page 085 --><!-- page 086 --></p>
</section></section></section><section class="section2" id="work-no-idleness-here"><h2><a class="toclink" href="#work-no-idleness-here">Work: “No idleness here.”<!-- page 086 --></a></h2>
<p>Student education was further undermined by the amount of work the students had to do to support the schools.<!-- page 086 -->
Because Indian Affairs officials had anticipated that the residential schools would be self-sufficient, students were expected to raise or grow and prepare most of the food they ate, to make and repair much of their clothing, and to maintain the schools.<!-- page 086 -->
As a result, most of the residential schools operated on what was referred to as the “half-day system.”<!-- page 086 -->
Under this system—which amounted to institutionalized child labour—students were in class for half the day and in what was supposed to be vocational training for the other half.<!-- page 086 -->
Often, as many students, teachers, and inspectors observed, the time allocated for vocational training was actually spent in highly repetitive labour that provided little in the way of training.<!-- page 086 -->
Rather, it served to maintain the school operations.<!-- page 086 --></p>
<p>The half-day system was not a formally mandated system.<!-- page 086 -->
Some schools did not use it, and those that did use it implemented it on their own terms.<!-- page 086 -->
When, in 1922, Indian Affairs education official Russell Ferrier recommended that the Chapleau, Ontario, school implement the half-day system, he had to rely on his memory of visits to other schools in order to describe how the system operated.<!-- page 086 -->
Indian Affairs had no official written description of the system.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^244</a><!-- page 086 -->
This is telling evidence of the haphazard way in which residential schools were managed.<!-- page 086 --></p>
<p>While the half-day system was supposed to apply only to the older students, the reality was that every student worked.<!-- page 086 -->
Above and beyond the half-day that students spent in vocational training, it was not uncommon for them to perform daily chores both before and after school.<!-- page 086 -->
As a result, students often spent more than half a day working for the school.<!-- page 086 -->
At High River, Alberta, in the 1880s, students who were not learning a trade were expected to put in two hours a day of chores in the winter and four hours in the summer.<!-- page 086 -->
According to Principal E.<!-- page 086 -->
Claude, “To these youngest ones pertained the weeding of the garden and the house work on their side of the school, and I must say, that this summer none denied our watchword, ‘No idleness here,’ as all work was exclusively done by the pupils.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^245</a><!-- page 086 --></p>
<p>From the time the schools were opened, parents and inspectors raised concerns about just how much work students were being required to do.<!-- page 086 -->
Inspector T. P. Wadsworth claimed in 1884 that the boys at the Battleford school generally enjoyed their chores, but added that he would protest “against forcing these little fellows to haul water every day and all day from the river in winter, as was the case last year.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^246</a><!-- page 086 -->
In 1886, Qu’Appelle school principal Joseph Hugonnard wrote, “During the summer they have more manual labor and recreation.<!-- page 086 --><!-- page 087 -->
The parents cannot understand that the pupils are here to learn how to work as well as to read and write, we therefore cannot at present devote too much time to the former.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^247</a><!-- page 087 -->
Inspector Wadsworth returned to the issue of overwork in 1893, when he said that much of the farm work at the Middlechurch, Manitoba, school was too much for the boys.<!-- page 087 -->
The girls were also set to work in the laundry at a “tender age.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^248</a><!-- page 087 -->
Gilbert Wuttunee, who attended the Battleford school in the first decade of the twentieth century, recalled, “They didn’t do any farm work or any kind of work until you got to, at that time, standard three, whether you were nine years old or fifteen years old.”<!-- page 087 -->
After he turned nine, he “never saw another full day of school until I left.”<!-- page 087 -->
By then, the school had drastically reduced the number of trades it taught: “There was just blacksmithing, carpentering and farming.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^249</a><!-- page 087 -->
According to Lillian Elias, each fall, a barge would arrive in Aklavik, loaded with logs for the school furnace.<!-- page 087 -->
The students would form a long chain leading from the barge to the furnace room and, with the assistance of the school staff, unload the barge.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^250</a><!-- page 087 --></p>
<p><img alt="Carpenter’s shop in the Battleford school, 1894. Saskatchewan Archives Board, R-B7." src="image-autofix/page-087.jpg" /><!-- page 087 --></p>
<p>The work was inadequately supervised and often dangerous.<!-- page 087 -->
There are accounts of students’ getting hands caught in power equipment in the school laundries, the kitchens, workshops, and fields.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^251</a><!-- page 087 -->
Principals tended to place the blame on student carelessness and neglected to report such injuries to the government.<!-- page 087 -->
Several injuries were recorded only after the student’s parents complained or the government received a bill for the hospital treatment of a student.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^252</a><!-- page 087 -->
In December 1935, a mangle (a type of clothes wringer) at the Qu’Appelle school crushed several fingers on Florence McLeod’s right hand, which were amputated.<!-- page 087 -->
The school principal, G. Leonard, stressed that “this mangle has been in use at this school for several years and all the girls are familiar with its operation.”<!-- page 087 --><!-- page 088 -->
Indian Affairs secretary A. F. MacKenzie concluded that “all the necessary precautions were taken, and, while the accident to Florence McLeod is regretted, it was through no fault of the school management.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^253</a><!-- page 088 -->
The school’s failure to protect its students can be seen in the fact that McLeod’s father, Henry, had been injured in a similar fashion when he was a student at the same school.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^254</a><!-- page 088 -->
In 1941, a twelve-year-old boy lost all the fingers on one hand in an accident in the Brandon, Manitoba, school barn.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^255</a><!-- page 088 -->
Eight years later, fifteen-year-old Rodney Beardy died in a tractor accident at the same school.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^256</a><!-- page 088 -->
A student at the Edmonton school lost a foot in 1944 after an accident during the operation of a machine used in the preparation of fodder.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^257</a><!-- page 088 -->
Two boys from the Birtle, Manitoba, school were injured in a truck accident in 1942.<!-- page 088 -->
From Indian Affairs correspondence, it appears that the accident involved a truck carrying seventy boys who were being taken from the school to the fields to do farm work.<!-- page 088 -->
Indian Affairs official R. A. Hoey criticized the principal for allowing the practice to take place, noting that “it is almost unbelievable that the principal should permit 70 pupils to be conveyed in a truck.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^258</a><!-- page 088 --></p>

<p>Even though the half-day system was supposedly eliminated in the early 1950s, students continued to be overworked.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^259</a><!-- page 088 -->
After Sam Ross ran away from the Birtle school in 1959, he told Indian Affairs official J. R. Bell that he wanted to continue his education, but had been forced to work “too hard” at the school.<!-- page 088 -->
He said that from September to Christmas of the previous year, he had worked in the school barn every day between “6:00 a.m. and 7:00 a.m. and from 8:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. again at recess, from 4:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. and had had to stoke up the furnace with coal at 10:00 o’clock before retiring.”<!-- page 088 --><!-- page 089 -->
Ross said that “he liked school but not working like a hired hand.”<!-- page 089 -->
Bell recommended that the amount of student labour being done at the Birtle school be investigated.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^260</a><!-- page 089 --></p>

<p>The government’s hostile approach to Aboriginal languages was reiterated in numerous policy directives.<!-- page 089 -->
In 1883, Indian Commissioner Edgar Dewdney instructed Battleford school principal Thomas Clarke that great attention was to be given “towards imparting a knowledge of the art of reading, writing and speaking the English language rather than that of Cree.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^261</a><!-- page 089 -->
In 1889, Deputy Minister of Indian Affairs Lawrence Vankoughnet informed Bishop Paul Durieu that in the new Cranbrook, British Columbia, school, mealtime conversations were to be “conducted exclusively in the English language.”<!-- page 089 -->
The principal was also to set a fixed time during which Aboriginal languages could be spoken.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^262</a><!-- page 089 -->
In 1890, Indian Commissioner Hayter Reed proposed, “At the most the native language is only to be used as a vehicle of teaching and should be discontinued as such as soon as practicable.”<!-- page 089 -->
English was to be the primary language of instruction, “even where French is taught.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^263</a><!-- page 089 -->
The Indian Affairs “Programme of Studies for Indian Schools” of 1893 advised, “Every effort must be made to induce pupils to speak English, and to teach them to understand it; unless they do the whole work of the teacher is likely to be wasted.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^264</a><!-- page 089 --></p>
<p>Principals regularly reported on their success in suppressing Aboriginal languages.<!-- page 089 -->
In 1887, Principal E. Claude boasted that his thirty students at the High River school “all understand English passably well and few are unable to express themselves in English.<!-- page 089 -->
They talk English in recreation.<!-- page 089 -->
I scarcely need any coercive means to oblige them to do so.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^265</a><!-- page 089 -->
In 1898, the Kamloops principal reported that “English is the only language used at all times by the pupils.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^266</a><!-- page 089 -->
That same year, the Mission, British Columbia, principal wrote, “English is the common language of the school, the Indian language is indeed seldom heard in the institution, except with the newly arrived pupils.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^267</a><!-- page 089 -->
The 1898 report from the principal of the Anglican school at Onion Lake indicated that the school was one of the few exceptions.<!-- page 089 -->
There, the children were taught to “read and write both Cree and English.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^268</a><!-- page 089 -->
Inspectors viewed the continued use of Aboriginal languages by the students as a sign of failure.<!-- page 089 -->
The principal of the Red Deer school was taken to task in 1903 by an inspector who felt that a “serious drawback to school work, as well as an evidence of bad discipline, was the use of the Cree language, which was quite prevalent.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^269</a><!-- page 089 --></p>
<p>This policy of language suppression continued well into the twentieth century.<!-- page 089 -->
After a 1935 tour of Canada, Oblate Superior General Théodore Labouré expressed concern over the strict enforcement of prohibitions against speaking Aboriginal languages.<!-- page 089 --><!-- page 090 -->
In his opinion, “The forbidding of children to speak Indian, even during recreation, was so strict in some of our schools that any lapse would be severely punished—to the point that children were led to consider it a serious offense.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^270</a><!-- page 090 --></p>
<p><img alt="Inuit students at the Joseph Bernier School, Chesterfield Inlet, 1956. Diocese of Churchill-Hudson Bay." src="image-autofix/page-090.jpg" /><!-- page 090 --></p>
<p>Students had strong memories of being punished for ‘speaking Indian.’ Mary Angus, who attended the Battleford school in the late nineteenth century, said that students caught speaking their own language were given a close haircut: “All the hair cut to be as a man, that what they do, for us not to talk.<!-- page 090 -->
We were afraid of that, to have our hair cut.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^271</a><!-- page 090 -->
At the Fraser Lake school in British Columbia, Mary John said she could speak her own language only in whispers.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^272</a><!-- page 090 -->
Melvina McNabb was seven years old when she was enrolled in the File Hills school, and “I couldn’t talk a word of English.<!-- page 090 -->
I talked Cree and I was abused for that, hit, and made to try to talk English.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^273</a><!-- page 090 -->
Raymond Hill, who was a student at the Mohawk Institute in Brantford in the early years of the twentieth century, said, “I lost my language.<!-- page 090 -->
They threatened us with a strapping if we spoke it, and within a year I lost all of it.<!-- page 090 -->
They said they thought we were talking about them.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^274</a><!-- page 090 --></p>
<p>Language use often continued in secret.<!-- page 090 -->
Mary Englund recalled that while Aboriginal languages were banned at the Mission school in the early twentieth century, children would still speak it to one another.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^275</a><!-- page 090 -->
Clyde Peters said he stopped speaking his Aboriginal language at the Mount Elgin school after he found out the school punished students for doing so.<!-- page 090 -->
“I never got the strap for it but I was warned enough that I didn’t do it.”<!-- page 090 -->
Even after that, he and his friends would speak to each other when they thought no one else could hear them.<!-- page 090 --><!-- page 091 -->
“When we’d go up in the dormitories in the evening I had a friend from Sarnia who I could talk with.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^276</a><!-- page 091 --></p>
<p>Many of the students came to the school fluent in an Aboriginal language, with little or no understanding of French or English.<!-- page 091 -->
This trend continued well into the post-war period.<!-- page 091 -->
For these children, the first few months in the school were disorienting and frightening.<!-- page 091 -->
Arthur McKay arrived at the Sandy Bay, Manitoba, school in the early 1940s with no knowledge of English.<!-- page 091 -->
“They told me not to speak my language and everything, so I always pretended to be asleep at my desk so they wouldn’t ask me anything.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^277</a><!-- page 091 -->
Peter Nakogee recalled being punished for writing in his notebook in Cree syllabics at the Fort Albany, Ontario, school.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^278</a><!-- page 091 --></p>
<p>Meeka Alivaktuk came to the Pangnirtung school in what is now Nunavut with no knowledge of English.<!-- page 091 -->
When she failed to obey an instruction because she did not understand it, she was slapped on the hands.<!-- page 091 -->
“That’s how my education began.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^279</a><!-- page 091 -->
On his first day of school in Pangnirtung, the teacher overheard Sam Kautainuk speaking to a friend in Inuktitut.<!-- page 091 -->
“He took a ruler and grabbed my head like this and then smacked me in the mouth with the ruler four times.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^280</a><!-- page 091 --></p>
<p>At the Qu’Appelle school in the mid-1960s, Greg Rainville said, he was punished for failing to carry out instructions given to him in a language he did not understand.<!-- page 091 -->
“The nuns would get frustrated with you when they talked to you in French or English, and you’re not knowing what they’re talking about, and you’re pulled around by the ear.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^281</a><!-- page 091 -->
At the Shubenacadie school, a staff member once caught William Herney speaking Mi’kmaq with his brother.<!-- page 091 -->
She strapped him and then washed his mouth out with soap.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^282</a><!-- page 091 -->
Alphonsine McNeely underwent the same punishment at the Roman Catholic school at Aklavik in the 1940s.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^283</a><!-- page 091 -->
Pierrette Benjamin said she was forced to eat soap at the La Tuque school.<!-- page 091 -->
“The principal, she put it in my mouth, and she said, ‘Eat it, eat it.’”284<!-- page 091 --></p>
<p>The language policy disrupted families.<!-- page 091 -->
When John Kistabish left the Amos, Québec, school, he could no longer speak Algonquin, and his parents could not speak French, the language that he had been taught in the school.<!-- page 091 -->
As a result, he found it almost impossible to communicate with them about the abuse he experienced at the school.<!-- page 091 -->
“I had tried to talk with my parents, and, no, it didn’t work…<!-- page 091 -->
We were well anyway because I knew that they were my parents, when I left the residential school, but the communication wasn’t there.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^285</a><!-- page 091 --></p>
<p>Culture was attacked as well as language.<!-- page 091 -->
In his memoirs, Stoney Chief John Snow tells of how at the Morley, Alberta, school, the “education consisted of nothing that had any relationship to our homes and culture.<!-- page 091 -->
Indeed Stoney culture was condemned explicitly and implicitly.”<!-- page 091 -->
He recalled being taught that the only good people on earth were non-Indians and, specifically, white Christians.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^286</a><!-- page 091 -->
Andrew Bull Calf recalled that at the residential school in Cardston, Alberta, students were not only punished for speaking their own languages, but they also were discouraged from participating in traditional cultural activities.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^287</a><!-- page 091 -->
Evelyn Kelman recalled that the principal at the Brocket, Alberta, school warned students that if they attended a Sun Dance that was to be held during the summer, they would be strapped on their return to school.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^288</a><!-- page 091 --><!-- page 092 -->
Marilyn Buffalo recalled being told by Hobbema, Alberta, school staff that the Sun Dance was ‘devil worship.’289 One year, Sarah McLeod returned to the Kamloops school with a miniature totem pole that a family member had given her for her birthday.<!-- page 092 -->
When she proudly showed it to one of the nuns, it was taken from her and thrown out.<!-- page 092 -->
She was told that it was nothing but devilry.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^290</a><!-- page 092 --></p>
<p>School officials did not limit their opposition to Aboriginal culture to the classroom.<!-- page 092 -->
In 1942, Gleichen, Alberta, principal John House became involved in a campaign to have two Blackfoot chiefs deposed, in part because of their support for traditional dance ceremonies.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^291</a><!-- page 092 -->
In 1943, F. E. Anfield, the principal of the Alert Bay, British Columbia, school, wrote a letter encouraging former students not to participate in local Potlatches, implying that such ceremonies were based on outdated superstition, and led to impoverishment and family neglect.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^292</a><!-- page 092 --></p>
<p>Even when it did not directly disparage Aboriginal culture, the curriculum undermined Aboriginal identity.<!-- page 092 -->
Thaddee Andre, who attended the Sept-Îles, Québec, school in the 1950s, recalled how as a student he wanted “to resemble the white man, then in the meantime, they are trying by all means to strip you of who you are as an Innu.<!-- page 092 -->
When you are young, you are not aware of what you are losing as a human being.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^293</a><!-- page 092 --></p>
<p>It was not until the 1960s that attitudes began to change about the place of Aboriginal language and culture in residential schools.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^294</a><!-- page 092 -->
Alex Alikashuak said that at the Churchill school, which operated in the 1960s, there were no restrictions on the use of Aboriginal languages.<!-- page 092 -->
He recalled, “The only time, real time we spoke English was when we were in the classroom, or we’re talking to one of the administration staff, and or somebody from town that’s not Inuit, but otherwise we, everybody spoke our language.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^295</a><!-- page 092 -->
The Canadian Welfare Council’s 1967 report on nine Saskatchewan residential schools described “an emphasis on relating course content to the Indian culture” as “imaginative” and a sign of progress in “making the educational experience meaningful for the Indian child.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^296</a><!-- page 092 -->
By 1968, the Roman Catholic school in Cardston was incorporating Blackfoot into its educational program.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^297</a><!-- page 092 -->
In some schools, Aboriginal teachers were brought in to teach dancing and singing.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^298</a><!-- page 092 -->
However, as late as the 1969–70 school year, there were only seven Indian Affairs schools that offered courses in Aboriginal languages or used Aboriginal languages as the language of instruction.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^299</a><!-- page 092 --></p>
<p>Despite the encouragement that was offered in some schools, and the students’ efforts to keep their language alive, the overall impact was language loss.<!-- page 092 -->
Of her experiences at the Baptist school in Whitehorse and the Anglican school in Carcross, Rose Dorothy Charlie said, “They took my language.<!-- page 092 -->
They took it right out of my mouth.<!-- page 092 -->
I never spoke it again.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^300</a><!-- page 092 -->
In some cases, the residential school experience led parents to decide not to teach their children an Aboriginal language.<!-- page 092 -->
Both of Joline Huskey’s parents attended residential school in the Northwest Territories.<!-- page 092 -->
As a result of their experience in the schools, they raised their daughter to speak English.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^301</a><!-- page 092 --><!-- page 093 -->
When Bruce Dumont was sent to residential school in Onion Lake, Saskatchewan, his mother warned him not to speak Cree.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^302</a><!-- page 093 --></p>
</section><section class="section2" id="arranging-and-blocking-marriages"><h2><a class="toclink" href="#arranging-and-blocking-marriages">Arranging and blocking marriages<!-- page 093 --></a></h2>
<p>Through the residential schools, Indian Affairs and church officials sought to extend their control into the most intimate aspects of the lives of Aboriginal children.<!-- page 093 -->
Indian Affairs officials believed that because the department had spent money educating students, it had gained the right to determine whom they married.<!-- page 093 -->
Government officials feared that if students married someone who had not also been educated at a residential school, they would revert to traditional ‘uncivilized’ ways.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^303</a><!-- page 093 -->
The control of marriage was part of the ongoing policy of forced assimilation.<!-- page 093 -->
In 1890, Indian Commissioner Hayter Reed criticized Qu’Appelle principal Joseph Hugonnard for allowing female students from the Qu’Appelle school to marry boys who had not gone to school, without first getting Indian Affairs’ approval.<!-- page 093 -->
Reed argued, “The contention that the parents have the sole right to decide such matters cannot for one moment be admitted.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^304</a><!-- page 093 --></p>
<p>The government not only encouraged marriage between students, but it also began to make marriage part of the process of getting out of residential school.<!-- page 093 -->
In his annual report for 1896, Deputy Minister Hayter Reed wrote, “It is considered advisable, where pupils are advanced in years and considered capable of providing for themselves, to bring about a matrimonial alliance, either at the time of being discharged from the school or as soon after as possible.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^305</a><!-- page 093 -->
In other words, the principals were expected to arrange marriages for the older students.<!-- page 093 --></p>
<p>Principals regularly reported and celebrated student marriages, and, indeed, did often arrange them.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^306</a><!-- page 093 -->
Reverend P. Claessen, principal of the Kuper Island school, reported in 1909 that he had succeeded in “engaging one of our leaving girls with one of our best old boys.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^307</a><!-- page 093 -->
Kamloops school principal A. M. Carion reported, “It is gratifying to note again that since my last report, two more couples of ex-pupils have been united in the bonds of holy wedlock.<!-- page 093 -->
The ex-pupils who marry other ex-pupils are better able to retain the habits of civilized life, which they acquired at the school.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^308</a><!-- page 093 --></p>
<p>Efforts were also made to block marriages deemed to be unsuitable.<!-- page 093 -->
In 1895, Indian agent Magnus Begg told members of the Blackfoot Reserve that “no young man could marry a girl from an Industrial or board [sic] School without having prepared a house with two rooms, and owning cows, with the necessary stabling, &amp;c.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^309</a><!-- page 093 -->
In that same year, principals and Indian agents were instructed to seek departmental permission prior to allowing students to marry.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^310</a><!-- page 093 --></p>
<p>Principals continued to arrange marriages into the 1930s.<!-- page 093 -->
In 1936, the principal of the Roman Catholic school at Onion Lake prepared a list of students who had turned sixteen and who, he believed, should not be discharged.<!-- page 093 -->
He noted that he insisted on keeping the students, since he would “always try to marry them as soon as they leave the school.”<!-- page 093 --><!-- page 094 -->
He wanted to keep one eighteen-year-old student in the school until the fall threshing was complete.<!-- page 094 -->
Then, she would be married to a former pupil.<!-- page 094 -->
He wanted to keep another eighteen-year-old until “she gets married during the year.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^311</a><!-- page 094 -->
In 1922, the head of the Presbyterian Church’s Winnipeg Committee on Indian Work urged the government to make it “unlawfull [sic] for a pupil or ex-pupil of the School to marry or be married without the permission of the Indian Agent.”<!-- page 094 -->
The Presbyterians proposed that the children of such unauthorized marriages be denied Treaty annuities until they reached the age of twenty-one and be prohibited from attending school.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^312</a><!-- page 094 -->
Although the measure was not adopted, it is reflective of the church’s lack of respect for the autonomy of Aboriginal people.<!-- page 094 --></p>
</section><section class="section2" id="food-always-hungry"><h2><a class="toclink" href="#food-always-hungry">Food: “Always hungry”<!-- page 094 --></a></h2>
<p>In his memoir of his years as a student at the Mount Elgin school in southern Ontario in the early twentieth century, Enos Montour wrote that the boys “were always hungry.<!-- page 094 -->
Grub was the beginning and end of all conversations.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^313</a><!-- page 094 -->
According to Eleanor Brass, the dinners at the File Hills, Saskatchewan, school consisted “of watery soup with no flavour, and never any meat.”<!-- page 094 -->
One winter, it seemed to her that they ate fish every day.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^314</a><!-- page 094 -->
In fair weather, the boys would trap gophers and squirrels, and roast them over open fires to supplement their meagre diets.<!-- page 094 -->
Sometimes, they would share these treats with the girls at the school.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^315</a><!-- page 094 -->
Mary John, who attended the Fraser Lake, British Columbia, school, recalled that the meals were dull and monotonous: a regular diet of porridge interspersed with boiled barley and beans, and bread covered with lard.<!-- page 094 -->
Weeks might go by without any fish or meat; sugar and jam were reserved for special occasions.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^316</a><!-- page 094 -->
A former student of the Hay River school in the Northwest Territories recalled that in the years following the First World War, he “didn’t see jam from the time I got off the boat to the time I got back on to come back down.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^317</a><!-- page 094 -->
Another student from that school recalled a constant diet of fish: “They would boil it up real good until the meat falls away, the bones and scales all floating around, then mix in flour and serve it up.<!-- page 094 -->
I won’t use flour for my dogs because there’s not much good in it.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^318</a><!-- page 094 --></p>
<p>The reports of government inspectors confirm these student memories.<!-- page 094 -->
An 1895 report on an inspection of the Middlechurch school concluded, “The ‘bill of fare’ is plain.<!-- page 094 -->
I believed it to be barely sufficient for the older pupils, who have now, at fifteen to eighteen years of age, larger apetites [sic] than they will have when older.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^319</a><!-- page 094 -->
In 1918, Indian agent John Smith inspected the Kamloops school and reported his “suspicion that the vitality of the children is not sufficiently sustained from a lack of nutritious food, or enough of the same for vigorous growing children.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^320</a><!-- page 094 -->
A local doctor concurred, writing that “for some months past the food supplied has been inadequate for the needs of the children.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^321</a><!-- page 094 -->
There were some positive assessments, but Indian Affairs official Martin Benson questioned their accuracy.<!-- page 094 --><!-- page 095 -->
“In almost every instance when meals are mentioned by Inspectors they are said to be well cooked.<!-- page 095 -->
I doubt very much whether they ever took a full regulation school meal of bread and dripping, or boiled beef and potatoes.”<!-- page 095 -->
In Benson’s opinion, “The bill of fare is decidedly monotonous and makes no allowance for peculiarities of taste or constitution.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^322</a><!-- page 095 --></p>
<p><img alt="Ahousaht, British Columbia, students in the school cafeteria. British Columbia Archives, PN-15589." src="image-autofix/page-095.jpg" /><!-- page 095 --></p>
<p>When funding was cut during the Depression of the 1930s, it was the students who paid the price—in more ways than one.<!-- page 095 -->
At the end of the 1930s, it was discovered that the cook at the Presbyterian school at Kenora was actually selling bread to the students, at the rate of ten cents a loaf.<!-- page 095 -->
When asked if the children got enough to eat at meals, she responded, “Yes, but they were always hungry.”<!-- page 095 -->
The Indian agent ordered an end to the practice.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^323</a><!-- page 095 -->
The fact that hungry students would be reduced to buying bread to supplement their meals in 1939 highlights the government’s failure to provide schools with the resources needed to feed students adequately.<!-- page 095 --></p>
<p>Milk was in constant shortage at many schools, in part due to the poor health and small size of the school dairy herds.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^324</a><!-- page 095 -->
As late as 1937, disease among the cows at the Kamloops school had cut milk production by 50%.<!-- page 095 -->
To the principal’s frustration, Ottawa refused to fund the construction of an additional barn, which would have allowed for an increase in milk production and the isolation of sick animals.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^325</a><!-- page 095 -->
Even when the dairy herds were producing satisfactorily, the students did not always get the full benefit.<!-- page 095 --><!-- page 096 -->
Often, the milk was separated, with the skimmed milk served to the children.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^326</a><!-- page 096 -->
The milk fat was turned to butter and cream, which was frequently sold to raise funds for the schools.<!-- page 096 -->
Inspector W. Murison noted in 1925 that the cows at the Elkhorn, Manitoba, school were producing enough milk for the school, but the students were not getting “the full benefit of this milk as I found that they were making about 30 lbs.<!-- page 096 -->
of butter a week, and a great deal of the milk given the children is separated milk, which has not much food value.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^327</a><!-- page 096 --></p>
<p><img alt="Students working in the kitchen at the Cross Lake, Manitoba, school in the early 1920s. St. Boniface Historical Society Archives; Roman Catholic Archbishop of Keewatin-The Pas Fonds; N1826." src="image-autofix/page-096.jpg" /><!-- page 096 --></p>
<p>In 1942, the federal government issued Canada’s Official Food Rules, an early version of the Canada Food Guide.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^328</a><!-- page 096 -->
Inspectors quickly discovered that residential school diets did not measure up to the Food Rules.<!-- page 096 -->
Dr. L. B. Pett, the head of the federal government’s Nutrition Division, concluded in 1947, on the basis of inspections his staff had done, that “no school was doing a good feeding job.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^329</a><!-- page 096 -->
It was not until the late 1950s that the federal government adopted a residential school food allowance calculated to provide a diet deemed “fully adequate nutritionally.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^330</a><!-- page 096 -->
Even with the increase in funding, schools still had difficulty providing students with adequate meals.<!-- page 096 -->
A 1966 dietician’s report on Yukon Hall in Whitehorse observed that although the Canada Food Guide requirements were being met, “because of the appetite of this age group, the staff are finding 66¢ per day per student is limiting.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^331</a><!-- page 096 --><!-- page 097 -->
In 1969, an official at Coudert Hall in Whitehorse wrote, “The $0.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^80</a><!-- page 097 -->
alloted [sic] per student for food is not sufficient.<!-- page 097 -->
In the north we find prices sky high.”<!-- page 097 -->
To cope with the problem, the residence sometimes had to buy “less meat and served maccaroni [sic] products.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^332</a><!-- page 097 -->
A November 1970 inspection of the Dauphin, Manitoba, school noted that the “menu appears to be short of the recommended two servings of fruit per day.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^333</a><!-- page 097 --></p>
<p>In their home communities, many students had been raised on food that their parents had hunted, fished, or harvested.<!-- page 097 -->
These meals were very different from the European diets served at the schools.<!-- page 097 -->
This change in diet added to the students’ sense of disorientation.<!-- page 097 -->
Daisy Diamond found the food at residential school to be unfamiliar and unpalatable.<!-- page 097 -->
“When I was going to Shingwauk, the food didn’t taste very good, because we didn’t have our traditional food there, our moose meat, our bannock, and our berries.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^334</a><!-- page 097 -->
Dora Fraser, from the eastern Arctic, found it difficult to adjust to the food served in the hostels.<!-- page 097 -->
“We were eating canned food, beans, peas, red beans.<!-- page 097 -->
The food was terrible.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^335</a><!-- page 097 -->
Even when traditional foods were prepared, the school cooks made them in ways that were unfamiliar and unappetizing to the students.<!-- page 097 -->
Ellen Okimaw, who attended the Fort Albany, Ontario, school, had vivid memories of poorly cooked fish served at the schools.<!-- page 097 -->
The school cook had simply “dumped the whole thing, and boiled them like that, just like that without cleaning them.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^336</a><!-- page 097 --></p>
<p>Bernard Catcheway recalled that in the 1960s at the Pine Creek, Manitoba, school, “we had to eat all our food even though we didn’t like it.<!-- page 097 -->
There was a lot of times there I seen other students that threw up and they were forced to eat their own, their own vomit.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^337</a><!-- page 097 -->
Bernard Sutherland recalled students at the Fort Albany school being forced to eat food that they had vomited.<!-- page 097 -->
“I saw in person how the children eat their vomit.<!-- page 097 -->
When they happened to be sick.<!-- page 097 -->
And they threw up while eating.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^338</a><!-- page 097 -->
These abuses led in 1999 to the conviction of Anna Wesley, a former staff member of the Fort Albany school, on three charges of administering a noxious substance.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^339</a><!-- page 097 --></p>
<p>Some schools did make allowances for traditional foods.<!-- page 097 -->
Simon Awashish recalled being allowed to trap for food while attending the Amos, Québec, school.<!-- page 097 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>When we brought in hares, we were asked if …<!-- page 097 -->
there was some members of our nation that came to work in the kitchen, and we asked them to cook the hare for us in the traditional Atikameg way, in order to keep some sort of contact with our traditional food that we had before, before we were separated from our community.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^340</a><!-- page 097 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Students who spoke of hunger also spoke of their efforts to improve their diet secretly.<!-- page 097 -->
Woodie Elias recalled being hungry all the time at the Anglican school in Aklavik.<!-- page 097 -->
“Once in a while we go raid the cellar and you can’t call that stealing; that was our food.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^341</a><!-- page 097 -->
When Dorothy Nolie helped out in the Alert Bay school kitchen, she and her co-workers would eat bread as they sliced it.<!-- page 097 -->
“Kids would come to me and ask me for bread, and I’d sneak it to them.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^342</a><!-- page 097 --><!-- page 098 -->
At the Moose Factory school in Ontario, Nellie Trapper said, students “used to steal food, peanut butter, whatever’s cooking in a pot.<!-- page 098 -->
There were big pots in there.<!-- page 098 -->
I remember taking figs from that pot.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^343</a><!-- page 098 --></p>
<p>Complaints about the limited, poorly prepared, monotonous diet were intensified by the fact that at many schools, the students knew the staff members were being served much better fare than they had.<!-- page 098 -->
At the school she attended in Saskatchewan, Inez Dieter said, “the staff used to eat like kings, kings and queens.”<!-- page 098 -->
Like many students, she said, she used the opportunity of working in the staff dining room to help herself to leftovers.<!-- page 098 -->
“I’d steal that and I’d eat, and I’d feel real good.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^344</a><!-- page 098 -->
Gladys Prince recalled how, at the Sandy Bay school in Manitoba, the “priests ate the apples, we ate the peelings.<!-- page 098 -->
That is what they fed us.<!-- page 098 -->
We never ate bread.<!-- page 098 -->
They were stingy them, their own, their own baking.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^345</a><!-- page 098 -->
When Frances Tait was given a position in the staff dining room, she said, she thought she had “died and gone to heaven ’cause even eating their leftovers were better than what we got.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^346</a><!-- page 098 -->
Hazel Bitternose, who attended schools in Lestock and Qu’Appelle, said she enjoyed working in the priests’ dining room.<!-- page 098 -->
“They had some good food there and I used to sneak some food and able to feed myself good there.<!-- page 098 -->
So that’s why I liked to work there.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^347</a><!-- page 098 --></p>
<p>The federal government knowingly chose not to provide schools with enough money to ensure that kitchens and dining rooms were properly equipped, that cooks were properly trained, and, most significantly, that food was purchased in sufficient quantity and quality for growing children.<!-- page 098 -->
It was a decision that left thousands of Aboriginal children vulnerable to disease.<!-- page 098 --></p>

<p>The number of students who died at Canada’s residential schools is not likely ever to be known in full.<!-- page 098 -->
The most serious gap in information arises from the incompleteness of the documentary record.<!-- page 098 -->
Many records have simply been destroyed.<!-- page 098 -->
According to a 1935 federal government policy, school returns could be destroyed after five years, and reports of accidents after ten years.<!-- page 098 -->
This led to the destruction of fifteen tonnes of waste paper.<!-- page 098 -->
Between 1936 and 1944, 200,000 Indian Affairs files were destroyed.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^348</a><!-- page 098 -->
Health records were regularly destroyed.<!-- page 098 -->
For example, in 1957, Indian and Northern Health Services was instructed to destroy “correspondence re routine arrangements re medical and dental treatments of Indians and Eskimos, such as transportation, escort services, admission to hospital, advice on treatment, requests for treatment, etc.”<!-- page 098 -->
after a period of two years.<!-- page 098 -->
Reports by doctors, dentists, and nurses were similarly assigned a two-year retention period.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^349</a><!-- page 098 --></p>
<p>Often, the existing record lacks needed detail.<!-- page 098 -->
For example, it was not uncommon for principals, in their annual reports, to state that a specific number of students had died in the previous year, but not to name them.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^350</a><!-- page 098 --><!-- page 099 -->
It was not until 1935 that Indian Affairs adopted a formal policy on how deaths at the schools were to be reported and investigated.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^351</a><!-- page 099 --></p>
<p>There can be no certainty that all deaths were, in fact, reported to Indian Affairs—the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada has located reports of student deaths in church records that are not reported in government documents.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^352</a><!-- page 099 -->
In some cases, school officials appear not to have recognized a responsibility to report student deaths to provincial vital statistics officials, meaning that these records may also be deficient.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^353</a><!-- page 099 --></p>
<p>As part of its work, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada has established a National Residential School Student Death Register.<!-- page 099 -->
The creation of this register marks the first effort in Canadian history to properly record the number of students who died in residential schools.<!-- page 099 -->
The register is made of up three sub-registers:<!-- page 099 --></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>the Register of Confirmed Deaths of Named Residential School Students (the “Named Register”);<!-- page 099 --></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the Register of Confirmed Deaths of Unnamed Residential School Students (the “Unnamed Register”); and<!-- page 099 --></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the Register of Deaths that Require Further Investigation (to determine if they should be placed on either the Named or Unnamed register).<!-- page 099 --></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>A January 2015 statistical analysis of the Named Register for the period from 1867 to 2000 identified 2,040 deaths.<!-- page 099 -->
The same analysis of a combination of the Named and Unnamed registers identified 3,201 reported deaths.<!-- page 099 -->
The greatest number of these deaths (1,328 on the Named Register and 2,434 on the Named and Unnamed registers) took place prior to 1940.<!-- page 099 -->
Graph 3 shows the overall death rate per 1,000 students for the residential schools during this period (figures are based on information in the combined Named and Unnamed registers).<!-- page 099 --></p>
<p>This graph suggests that the peak of the health crisis in the schools occurred in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.<!-- page 099 -->
It also shows that the death rate remained high until the 1950s.<!-- page 099 --></p>
<p>The death rates for Aboriginal children in the residential schools were far higher than those experienced by members of the general Canadian population.<!-- page 099 -->
Graph 4 compares the death rate per 1,000 of the general population of Canadian children aged five to fourteen with the death rates per 1,000 of the Named Register and the Named and Unnamed registers combined.<!-- page 099 -->
(Given the limitations in Statistics Canada’s historical data, the death rates are provided as five-year averages.)<!-- page 099 -->
As can be seen, until the 1950s Aboriginal children in residential schools died at a far higher rate than school-aged children in the general population.<!-- page 099 -->
It is only in the 1950s that the residential school death rates declined to a level comparable to that of the general school-aged population.<!-- page 099 -->
As late as the 1941–45 period, the Named and Unnamed Combined residential school death rate was 4.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^90</a><!-- page 099 -->

<p>rates were much lower than their historic highs, they were still double those of the general school-aged population.<!-- page 100 --></p>
<p>In nearly 50% of the cases (both in the Named and Unnamed registers), there is no recorded cause of death.<!-- page 100 -->
From those cases where the cause of death was reported, it is clear that until the 1950s, the schools were the sites of an ongoing tuberculosis crisis.<!-- page 100 -->
Tuberculosis accounted for just less than 50% of the recorded deaths (46.2% for the Named Register, and 47% for the Named and Unnamed registers combined).<!-- page 100 -->
The tuberculosis death rate remained high until the 1950s: its decline coincides with the introduction of effective drug treatment.<!-- page 100 -->
The next most frequently recorded causes of death were influenza (9.2% on the Named Register, and 9.1% of the deaths on the combined Named and Unnamed registers), pneumonia (6.9% on the Named Register, and 9.1% of the deaths on the combined Named and Unnamed registers), and general lung disease (3.4% on the Named Register, and 5.5% of the deaths on the combined Named and Unnamed registers).<!-- page 100 -->
Graph 5 shows the residential school tuberculosis death rate (figures are based on information in the combined Named and Unnamed registers).<!-- page 100 --></p>
<p>The tuberculosis health crisis in the schools was part of a broader Aboriginal health crisis that was set in motion by colonial policies that separated Aboriginal people from their land, thereby disrupting their economies and their food supplies.<!-- page 100 -->
This crisis was particularly intense on the Canadian Prairies.<!-- page 100 -->
Numerous federal government policies contributed to the undermining of Aboriginal health.<!-- page 100 -->

In making the Treaties, the government had promised to provide assistance to First Nations to allow them to make a transition from hunting to farming.<!-- page 101 -->
This aid was slow in coming and inadequate on arrival.<!-- page 101 -->
Restrictions in the <em>Indian Act</em> made it difficult for First Nations farmers to sell their produce or borrow money to invest in technology.<!-- page 101 -->
Reserve land was often agriculturally unproductive.<!-- page 101 -->
Reserve housing was poor and crowded, sanitation was inadequate, and access to clean water was limited.<!-- page 101 -->
Under these conditions, tuberculosis flourished.<!-- page 101 -->
Those people it did not kill were often severely weakened and likely to succumb to measles, smallpox, and other infectious diseases.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^354</a><!-- page 101 --></p>
<p>For Aboriginal children, the relocation to residential schools was generally no healthier than their homes had been on the reserves.<!-- page 101 -->
In 1897, Indian Affairs official Martin Benson reported that the industrial schools in Manitoba and the Northwest Territories had been “hurriedly constructed of poor materials, badly laid out, without due provision for lighting, heating or ventilation.”<!-- page 101 -->

I need not mention any school in particular, but I have urged improvement in several cases in regard to fire-protection.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^356</a><!-- page 102 --></p>
<p>Students’ health depended on clean water, good sanitation, and adequate ventilation.<!-- page 102 -->
But little was done to improve the poor living conditions that were identified at the beginning of the twentieth century.<!-- page 102 -->
In 1940, R. A. Hoey, who had served as the Indian Affairs superintendent of Welfare and Training since 1936, wrote a lengthy assessment of the condition of the existing residential schools.<!-- page 102 -->
He concluded that many schools were “in a somewhat dilapidated condition” and had “become acute fire hazards.”<!-- page 102 -->
He laid responsibility for the “condition of our schools, generally,” upon their “faulty construction.”<!-- page 102 -->
This construction, he said, had failed to meet “the minimum standards in the construction of public buildings, particularly institutions for the education of children.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^357</a><!-- page 102 -->
By 1940, the government had concluded that future policy should concentrate on the expansion of day schools for First Nations children.<!-- page 102 -->
As a result, many of the existing residential school buildings were allowed to continue to deteriorate.<!-- page 102 -->
A 1967 brief from the National Association of Principals and Administrators of Indian Residences—which included principals of both Catholic and Protestant schools—concluded, “In the years that the Churches have been involved in the administration of the schools, there has been a steady deterioration in essential services.<!-- page 102 -->
Year after year, complaints, demands and requests for improvements have, in the main, fallen upon deaf ears.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^358</a><!-- page 102 --></p>
<p><img alt="The Roman Catholic school at Sturgeon Landing, Saskatchewan, was destroyed by fire in September 1952. There was no loss of life. St. Boniface Historical Society Archives, Roman Catholic Archbishop of Keewatin-The Pas Fonds, N3637." src="image-autofix/page-103.jpg" /><!-- page 103 --></p>
<p>When E. A. Côté, the deputy minister responsible for Indian Affairs, met with church and school representatives to discuss the brief, he told them that only emergency repairs would be undertaken at schools that Indian Affairs intended to close.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^359</a><!-- page 103 --></p>
<p>The badly built and poorly maintained schools constituted serious fire hazards.<!-- page 103 -->
Defective firefighting equipment exacerbated the risk, and schools were fitted with inadequate and dangerous fire escapes.<!-- page 103 -->
Lack of access to safe fire escapes led to high death tolls in fires at the Beauval and Cross Lake schools.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^360</a><!-- page 103 -->
The Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada has determined that at least fifty-three schools were destroyed by fire.<!-- page 103 -->
There were at least 170 additional recorded fires.<!-- page 103 -->
At least forty students died in residential school fires.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^361</a><!-- page 103 -->
The harsh discipline and jail-like nature of life in the schools meant that many students sought to run away.<!-- page 103 -->
To prevent this, many schools deliberately ignored government instructions in relation to fire drills and fire escapes.<!-- page 103 -->
These were not problems only of the late nineteenth or early twentieth centuries.<!-- page 103 -->
Well into the twentieth century, recommendations for improvements went unheeded, and dangerous and forbidden practices were widespread and entrenched.<!-- page 103 -->
In the interests of cost containment, the Canadian government placed the lives of students and staff at risk for 130 years.<!-- page 103 --></p>
<p>The buildings were not only fire traps.<!-- page 103 -->
They were also incubators of disease.<!-- page 103 -->
Rather than helping combat the tuberculosis crisis in the broader Aboriginal community, the poor condition of the schools served to intensify it.<!-- page 103 -->
The 1906 annual report of Dr.<!-- page 103 -->
Peter Bryce, the chief medical officer for Indian Affairs, observed that “the Indian population of Canada has a mortality rate of more than double that of the whole population, and in some provinces more than three times.”<!-- page 103 -->
Tuberculosis was the prevalent cause of death. He described a cycle of disease in which infants and children were infected at home and sent to residential schools, where they infected other children.<!-- page 103 --><!-- page 104 -->
The children infected in the schools were “sent home when too ill to remain at school, or because of being a danger to the other scholars, and have conveyed the disease to houses previously free.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^362</a><!-- page 104 -->
The following year, Bryce published a damning report on the conditions at prairie boarding schools.<!-- page 104 -->
In an age when fresh air was seen as being central to the successful treatment of tuberculosis, he concluded that, with only a few exceptions, the ventilation at the schools was “extremely inadequate.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^363</a><!-- page 104 --></p>
<p><img alt="Old Sun’s, Alberta, dormitory. Diseases such as tuberculosis could spread quickly in crowded dormitories. General Synod Archives, Anglican Church of Canada, P75-103-S7-167." src="image-autofix/page-104.jpg" /><!-- page 104 --></p>
<p>He found the school staff and even physicians<!-- page 104 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>inclined to question or minimize the dangers of infection from scrofulous or consumptive pupils [scrofula and consumption were alternate names for types of tuberculosis] and nothing less than peremptory instructions as to how to deal with cases of disease existing in the schools will eliminate this ever-present danger of infection.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^364</a><!-- page 104 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>He gave the principals a questionnaire to complete regarding the health condition of their former students.<!-- page 104 -->
The responses from fifteen schools revealed that “of a total of 1,537 pupils reported upon nearly 25 per cent are dead, of one school with an absolutely accurate statement, 69 per cent of ex-pupils are dead, and that everywhere the almost invariable cause of death given is tuberculosis.”<!-- page 104 -->
He drew particular attention to the fate of the thirty-one students who had been discharged from the File Hills school: nine were in good health, and twenty-two were dead.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^365</a><!-- page 104 --></p>
<p>The extent of the health crisis was so severe that some people within the federal government and the Protestant churches became convinced that the only solution was to close the schools and replace them with day schools.<!-- page 104 --><!-- page 105 -->
However, the Indian Affairs minister of the day, Frank Oliver, refused to enact the plan without the support of the churches involved.<!-- page 105 -->
The plan foundered for lack of Roman Catholic support.<!-- page 105 -->
During the same period, Bryce recommended that the federal government take over all the<!-- page 105 -->
schools and turn them into sanatoria under his control.<!-- page 105 -->
This plan was rejected because it was viewed as being too costly, and it was thought that it would have met with church opposition.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^366</a><!-- page 105 --></p>
<p><img alt="Dr. Peter Bryce, Indian Affairs chief medical officer, recommended in 1909 that Canada’s residential schools be turned into sanatoria and placed under his administration. Library and Archives Canada, Topley Studio, a042966." src="image-autofix/page-105.jpg" /><!-- page 105 --></p>
<p>Instead of closing schools or turning them into sanatoria, the government’s major response to the health crisis was the negotiation in 1910 of a contract between Indian Affairs and the churches.<!-- page 105 -->
This contract increased the grants to the schools and imposed a set of standards for diet and ventilation.<!-- page 105 -->
The contract also required that students not be admitted “until, where practicable, a physician has reported that the child is in good health.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^367</a><!-- page 105 --></p>
<p>As noted earlier, although the contract led to improvements in the short term, inflation quickly eroded the benefit of the increase in grants. The situation was worsened by the cuts to the grants that were repeatedly imposed during the Great Depression of the 1930s. The underfunding created by the cuts guaranteed that students would be poorly fed, clothed, and housed.<!-- page 105 -->
As a result, children were highly susceptible to tuberculosis.<!-- page 105 -->
And, because the government was slow to put in place policies that would have prohibited the admission of children with tuberculosis, and ineffective in enforcing such policies once they were developed, healthy children became infected. As late as the 1950s, at some schools, pre-admission medical examinations appear to have been perfunctory, ineffective, or non-existent.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^368</a><!-- page 105 -->
In the long run, the 1910 contract proved to be no solution for the tuberculosis crisis.<!-- page 105 --></p>
<p>The schools often lacked adequate facilities for the treatment of sick children.<!-- page 105 -->
In 1893, Indian Affairs inspector T. P. Wadsworth reported that at the Qu’Appelle school, the “want of an infirmary is still very much felt.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^369</a><!-- page 105 -->
Those infirmaries that existed were often primitive.<!-- page 105 -->
On an 1891 visit to the Battleford school, Indian Commissioner Hayter Reed concluded that the hospital ward was in such poor shape that they had been obliged to move the children in it to the staff sitting room.<!-- page 105 -->
According to Reed, “The noise, as well as the bad smells, come from the lavatory underneath.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^370</a><!-- page 105 -->
Proposals to construct a small hospital at the Red Deer school in 1901 were not implemented.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^371</a><!-- page 105 --><!-- page 106 -->
There were also reports of inadequate isolation facilities at the Regina school (1901), the Anglican school in Onion Lake, Saskatchewan (1921), the Mission, British Columbia, school (1924), and the Muncey, Ontario, school (1935).<a href="footnote-placeholder">^372</a><!-- page 106 -->
When diphtheria broke out at Duck Lake, Saskatchewan, in 1909, the nine students who fell ill were placed in a “large isolated house.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^373</a><!-- page 106 --></p>
<p>Even though the 1910 contract required all schools to have hospital accommodation to prevent the spread of infectious disease, many schools continued to be without a proper infirmary.<!-- page 106 -->
The 1918 global influenza epidemic left four children dead at the Red Deer, Alberta, school.<!-- page 106 -->
When the influenza epidemic subsided, Principal J. F. Woodsworth complained to Indian Affairs, “For sickness, conditions at this school are nothing less than criminal.<!-- page 106 -->
We have no isolation ward and no hospital equipment of any kind.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^374</a><!-- page 106 -->
The Roman Catholic principals petitioned the federal government for the establishment of sick rooms, under the supervision of a competent nurse, at each school in 1924.<!-- page 106 -->
At the same time, they objected to the sanitary inspection of the schools by government-appointed nurses, since they recommended changes “leading to the transformation of our schools into hospitals or sanatoriums.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^375</a><!-- page 106 -->
There were also regular reports that schools could not afford to hire needed nursing staff.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^376</a><!-- page 106 -->
Indian Affairs officials continued to be critical of the quality of care provided by school infirmaries at the end of the 1950s.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^377</a><!-- page 106 -->
Complaints from principals make it clear that into the late 1960s, there were still severe limitations on the range of health services being provided to residential school students.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^378</a><!-- page 106 --></p>
<p>General Aboriginal health care was never a priority for the Canadian government.<!-- page 106 -->
Tuberculosis among Aboriginal people largely was ignored unless it threatened the general Canadian population.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^379</a><!-- page 106 -->
In 1937, Dr. H. W. McGill, the director of Indian Affairs, sent out an instruction that Indian health-care services “must be restricted to those required for the safety of limb, life or essential function.”<!-- page 106 -->
Hospital care was to be limited, spending on drugs was cut in half, and sanatoria and hospital treatment for chronic tuberculosis were eliminated.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^380</a><!-- page 106 --></p>
<p>The high death rates led many parents to refuse to send their children to residential school.<!-- page 106 -->
In 1897, Kah-pah-pah-mah-am-wa-ko-we-ko-chin (also known as Tom) was deposed from his position as a headman of the White Bear Reserve in what is now Saskatchewan for his vocal opposition to residential schools.<!-- page 106 -->
In making his case for a school on the reserve, he pointed to the death rate at the Qu’Appelle industrial school, adding, “Our children are not strong.<!-- page 106 -->
Many of them are sick most of the time, many of the children sent from this Reserve to the Schools have died.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^381</a><!-- page 106 --></p>
<p>Death casts a long shadow over many residential school memories.<!-- page 106 -->
Louise Moine attended the Qu’Appelle school in the early twentieth century.<!-- page 106 -->
She recalled one year when tuberculosis was “on the rampage in that school.<!-- page 106 -->
There was a death every month on the girls’ side and some of the boys went also.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^382</a><!-- page 106 -->
Of his years at the Roman Catholic school in Onion Lake, Joseph Dion recalled, “My schoolmates and I were not long in concluding that the lung sickness was fatal, hence as soon as we saw or heard of someone spitting blood, we immediately branded him for the grave.<!-- page 106 --><!-- page 107 -->
He had consumption: he had to die.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^383</a><!-- page 107 -->
Simon Baker’s brother Jim died from spinal meningitis at the Lytton, British Columbia, school.<!-- page 107 -->
“I used to hear him crying at night.<!-- page 107 -->
I asked the principal to take him to the hospital.<!-- page 107 -->
He didn’t.<!-- page 107 -->
After about two weeks, my brother was in so much pain, he was going out of his mind.<!-- page 107 -->
I pleaded with the principal for days to take him to a doctor.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^384</a><!-- page 107 --></p>
<p>Ray Silver said that he always blamed the Alberni school for the death of his brother Dalton.<!-- page 107 -->
“He was a little guy, laying in the bed in the infirmary, dying, and I didn’t know ’til he died.<!-- page 107 -->
You know that’s, that was the end of my education.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^385</a><!-- page 107 -->
The death of a child often prompted parents to withdraw the rest of their children from a school.<!-- page 107 -->
One former student said her father came to the school when her sister became ill at the Anglican school at Aklavik, Northwest Territories.<!-- page 107 -->
“He came upstairs and there we were.<!-- page 107 -->
He cried over us.<!-- page 107 -->
He took me home.<!-- page 107 -->
He put her in a hospital, and she died.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^386</a><!-- page 107 --></p>
<p>The high deaths rates in the schools were, in part, a reflection of the high death rates among the Aboriginal community in general.<!-- page 107 -->
Indian Affairs officials often tried to portray these rates as simply the price that Aboriginal people had to pay as part of the process of becoming civilized.<!-- page 107 -->
In reality, these rates were the price they paid for being colonized.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^387</a><!-- page 107 -->
Aboriginal livelihoods were based on access to the land; colonization disrupted that access and introduced new illnesses to North America.<!-- page 107 -->
Colonial policies helped wiped out food sources and confined Aboriginal people to poorly located reserves, with inadequate sanitation and shelter.<!-- page 107 -->
The schools could have served as institutions to help counter these problems.<!-- page 107 -->
To do that, however, they would have had to have been properly constructed, maintained, staffed, and supplied.<!-- page 107 -->
Government officials were aware of this.<!-- page 107 -->
They were also aware that death rates among students at residential schools were disproportionately high.<!-- page 107 -->
It would be wrong to say the government did nothing about this crisis: the 1910 contract did provide a substantial funding increase to the schools.<!-- page 107 -->
But the federal government never made the type of sustained investment in Aboriginal health, in either the communities or the schools, that could have addressed this crisis—which continues to the present.<!-- page 107 -->
The non-Aboriginal tuberculosis death rate declined before the introduction of life-saving drugs.<!-- page 107 -->
It was brought down by improvements in diet, housing, sanitation, and medical attention.<!-- page 107 -->
Had such measures been taken by the federal government earlier, they would have reduced both the Aboriginal death rates and the residential school students’ death rates.<!-- page 107 -->
By failing to take adequate measures that had been recommended to it, the federal government blighted the health of generations of Aboriginal people.<!-- page 107 --></p>

<p>Many of the early schools were part of larger church mission centres that might include a church, a dwelling for the missionaries, a farm, a sawmill, and a cemetery.<!-- page 107 -->
The mission cemetery might serve as a place of burial for students who died at school, members of the local community, and the missionaries themselves.<!-- page 107 --><!-- page 108 -->
For example, the cemetery at the Roman Catholic St. Mary’s mission, near Mission, British Columbia, was intended originally for priests and nuns from the mission as well as for students from the residential school.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^388</a><!-- page 108 --></p>
<p><img alt="Residential school students at the Roman Catholic cemetery in Fort George, Québec. Deschâtelets Archives." src="image-autofix/page-108.jpg" /><!-- page 108 --></p>
<p>During the influenza pandemic of 1918–19, many of the schools and missions were overwhelmed.<!-- page 108 -->
At the Fort St. James school and mission in British Columbia, the dead were buried in a common grave.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^389</a><!-- page 108 -->
At the Red Deer school, four students who died there were buried two to a grave to save costs.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^390</a><!-- page 108 -->
In some cases, student and staff graves were treated differently.<!-- page 108 -->
At the Spanish, Ontario, school, the graves of staff members were marked with headstones that, in the case of former priests and nuns, provided name and date of birth and death.<!-- page 108 -->
The burial spots of students were identified only by plain white crosses.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^391</a><!-- page 108 --></p>
<p>The general Indian Affairs policy was to hold the schools responsible for burial expenses when a student died at school.<!-- page 108 -->
The school generally determined the location and nature of that burial.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^392</a><!-- page 108 -->
Parental requests to have children’s bodies returned home for burial were generally refused as being too costly.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^393</a><!-- page 108 -->
In her memoirs, Eleanor Brass recalled how the body of one boy, who hung himself at the File Hills school in the early twentieth century, was buried on the Peepeekisis Reserve, even though his parents lived on the Carlyle Reserve.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^394</a><!-- page 108 -->
As late as 1958, Indian Affairs refused to return the body of a boy who had died at a hospital in Edmonton to his northern home community in the Yukon.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^395</a><!-- page 108 --></p>
<p>The reluctance to pay the cost of sending the bodies of children from residential schools home for burial ceremonies continued into the 1960s.<!-- page 108 -->
Initially, for example, Indian Affairs was initially unwilling to pay to send the body of twelve-year-old Charlie Wenjack back to his parents’ home community in Ogoki, Ontario, in 1966.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^396</a><!-- page 108 -->
When Charles Hunter drowned in 1974 while attending the Fort Albany school, it was decided, without consultation with his parents, to bury him in Moosonee rather than send him home to Peawanuck near Hudson Bay.<!-- page 108 --><!-- page 109 -->
It was not until 2011, after significant public efforts made on his behalf by his sister Joyce, who had never got to meet her older brother, that Charles Hunter’s body was exhumed and returned to Peawanuck for a community burial.<!-- page 109 -->
The costs were covered by funds that the <em>Toronto Star</em> raised from its readership.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^397</a><!-- page 109 --></p>
<p>A school closing might mean the cemetery would be left unattended.<!-- page 109 -->
When the Battleford school closed in 1914, Principal E.<!-- page 109 -->
Matheson reminded Indian Affairs that there was a school cemetery that contained the bodies of seventy to eighty individuals, most of whom were former students.<!-- page 109 -->
He worried that unless the government took steps to care for the cemetery, it would be overrun by stray cattle.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^398</a><!-- page 109 -->
In short, throughout the system’s history, children who died at school were buried in school or mission cemeteries, often in poorly marked graves.<!-- page 109 -->
The closing of the schools has led, in many cases, to the abandonment of these cemeteries.<!-- page 109 --></p>

<p>When Indian agent D. L. Clink returned a runaway student to the Red Deer industrial school in 1895, he noted that the boy’s head was bruised from where a teacher had hit him with a stick.<!-- page 109 -->
The school principal, John Nelson, told Clink that he “had been severe with him before but he would be more severe now.”<!-- page 109 -->
Worried that if he “left the boy he would be abused,” Clink took the boy away from the school.<!-- page 109 -->
He also recommended to Indian Affairs that the teacher who had struck the student be dismissed and brought up on charges, since “his actions in this and other cases would not be tolerated in a white school for a single day in any part of Canada.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^399</a><!-- page 109 -->
Clink’s report led Indian Affairs Deputy Minister Hayter Reed to direct his staff:<!-- page 109 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Instructions should be given, if not already sent, to the Principals of the various schools, that children are not to be whipped by anyone save the Principal, and even when such a course is necessary, great discretion should be used and they should not be struck on the head, or punished so severely that bodily harm might ensue.<!-- page 109 -->
The practice of corporal punishment is considered unnecessary as a general measure of discipline and should only be resorted to for very grave offences and as a deterrent example.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^400</a><!-- page 109 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reed’s instruction underlines a number of the recurrent problems with the Indian Affairs approach to discipline in residential schools.<!-- page 109 -->
First, Reed, who had previously been the Indian commissioner in western Canada, did not know whether there were regulations dealing with school discipline.<!-- page 109 -->
Second, his directive is vague: while it indicates where students should not be struck, it does not specify where they could be struck, or place limits on what students could be struck with; and neither are there limits on the number of blows.<!-- page 109 --><!-- page 110 -->
Third, it is not clear that these instructions were ever issued to the principals.<!-- page 110 -->
If they were, they were soon lost and forgotten.<!-- page 110 -->
In later years, when conflicts arose over discipline at the schools, Indian Affairs officials made no reference to the policy.<!-- page 110 -->
In 1920, Canon S. Gould, the general secretary of the Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada, asked Deputy Minister Campbell Scott, “Is corporal punishment for disciplinary purposes recognized, or permitted in the Indian Boarding schools?”<!-- page 110 -->
He noted that whether or not it was permitted, he imagined that it was applied in every residential school in the country.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^401</a><!-- page 110 -->
The first—and only—evidence of a nation-wide discipline policy for residential schools that the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada has been able to locate in the documents reviewed to date was issued in 1953.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^402</a><!-- page 110 --></p>
<p><img alt="The Mohawk Institute in Brantford, Ontario, was just one of the schools that had specific “punishment rooms.” General Synod Archives, Anglican Church of Canada, P75-103-S4-507." src="image-autofix/page-110.jpg" /><!-- page 110 --></p>
<p>The failure to establish and enforce a national policy on discipline meant that students were subject to disciplinary measures that would not, as Clink noted in 1895, be tolerated in schools for non-Aboriginal children.<!-- page 110 -->
Four years after Reed asked his staff to issue instructions on corporal punishment, Indian Commissioner David Laird reported that several children had been “too severely punished” at the Middlechurch school.<!-- page 110 -->
“Strappings on the bare back,” he wrote, was “too suggestive of the old system of flogging criminals.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^403</a><!-- page 110 --></p>
<p>Corporal punishment was often coupled with public humiliation.<!-- page 110 -->
In December 1896 in British Columbia, the Kuper Island school’s acting principal gave two boys “several lashes in the Presence of the Pupils” for sneaking into the girls’ dormitory at night.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^404</a><!-- page 110 -->
When, in 1934, the principal of the Shubenacadie school could not determine who had stolen money and chocolates from a staff member, he had the suspects thrashed with a seven-thonged strap and then placed on bread-and-water diets.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^405</a><!-- page 110 --><!-- page 111 --></p>
<p>Some schools had a specific room set aside to serve as a “punishment room.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^406</a><!-- page 111 -->
After a 1907 inspection of the Mohawk Institute in Brantford, the Ontario inspector for Indian agencies, J. G. Ramsden, reported, “I cannot say that I was favourably impressed with the sight of two prison cells in the boys [sic] play house.<!-- page 111 -->
I was informed, however, that these were for pupils who ran away from the institution, confinement being for a week at a time when pupils returned.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^407</a><!-- page 111 -->
In 1914, a father successfully sued the Mohawk Institute principal for locking his daughter in a cell for three days on what was described as a “water diet.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^408</a><!-- page 111 --></p>
<p>Boys at the Anglican school in Brocket, Alberta, were chained together as punishment for running away in 1920.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^409</a><!-- page 111 -->
At the Gleichen, Alberta, school, a principal was accused of shackling a boy to his bed and beating him with a quirt (a riding whip) until his back bled.<!-- page 111 -->
The principal admitted to having beaten the boy with the whip, but denied breaking the boy’s skin.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^410</a><!-- page 111 --></p>
<p>Abusive punishment often prompted children to run away.<!-- page 111 -->
The father of Duncan Sticks, a boy who died from exposure after running away from the Williams Lake school in British Columbia, told a coroner’s inquest in 1902 that, in the past, his son had run away because he had been “beaten with a quirt.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^411</a><!-- page 111 -->
A boy who ran away from the Anglican school in The Pas, after being severely beaten by the principal, nearly died of exposure.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^412</a><!-- page 111 --></p>
<p>The violent nature of the discipline at the schools came as a shock to students.<!-- page 111 -->
Isabelle Whitford said that prior to coming to the Sandy Bay school, she had never been physically disciplined.<!-- page 111 -->
“All my dad have to do was raise his voice, and we knew what he meant.<!-- page 111 -->
So, when I first got hit by the nuns, it was really devastating ’cause how can they hit me when my parents didn’t hit me, you know?”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^413</a><!-- page 111 -->
Rachel Chakasim said that at the Fort Albany school, “I saw violence for the first time.<!-- page 111 -->
I would see kids getting hit.<!-- page 111 -->
Sometimes in the classrooms, a yardstick was being used to hit.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^414</a><!-- page 111 --></p>
<p>Fred Brass said that his years at the Roman Catholic school at Kamsack, Saskatchewan, were “the hellish years of my life.<!-- page 111 -->
You know to be degraded by our so-called educators, to be beat by these people that were supposed to have been there to look after us, to teach us right from wrong.<!-- page 111 -->
It makes me wonder now today a lot of times I ask that question, who was right and who was wrong?”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^415</a><!-- page 111 -->
According to Geraldine Bob, the staff members at the Kamloops school she attended were not able to control their tempers once they began to punish a student.<!-- page 111 -->
“They would just start beating you and lose control and hurl you against the wall, throw you on the floor, kick you, punch you.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^416</a><!-- page 111 --></p>
<p>It was a common practice to shave the heads of students who ran away.<!-- page 111 -->
William Antoine recalled that at the Spanish, Ontario, school, this was done in front of the other students.<!-- page 111 -->
“They got all the boys to look at what is happening to this boy, what they were doing to him because he ran away.<!-- page 111 -->
They cut all his hair off and they pulled, pulled his pants down and he was kneeling on the floor, and holding onto the chair.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^417</a><!-- page 111 --><!-- page 112 -->
Eva Simpson said that at the Catholic school in The Pas, her cousin’s head was shaved for running away.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^418</a><!-- page 112 --></p>
<p>Many students spoke of teachers punishing them by pulling their ears.<!-- page 112 -->
At Sioux Lookout, Dorothy Ross said, “one time me and this other girl were, we were, were fooling around, we were teasing each other in our own language, we got, I got caught.<!-- page 112 -->
She pulled my ear so hard.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^419</a><!-- page 112 -->
Archie Hyacinthe could recall that in the classrooms of the Roman Catholic school in Kenora, “every time we didn’t listen, they would tug us behind the ear, or behind the neck, or on the elbows.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^420</a><!-- page 112 -->
Jonas Grandjambe recalled how the nun in charge of the boys’ dormitory at the Roman Catholic school in Aklavik, in the Northwest Territories, would “grab our ear and twist it.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^421</a><!-- page 112 -->
Delores Adolph said that the discipline she received at the Mission school impaired her hearing.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^422</a><!-- page 112 -->
Joseph Wabano said that at the Fort Albany, Ontario, school, the staff would hit students with a one-inch-thick board.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^423</a><!-- page 112 -->
Noel Starblanket recalled being constantly “slapped on the side of the head” at the Qu’Appelle school.<!-- page 112 -->
One teacher struck him in the face and broke his nose.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^424</a><!-- page 112 --></p>
<p>Mervin Mirasty said that at the Beauval, Saskatchewan, school, boys who were caught throwing snowballs were punished with blows to their hands from the blade of a hockey stick.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^425</a><!-- page 112 -->
As a punishment, Nellie Trapper, who attended the Moose Factory, Ontario, school in the 1950s, was assigned to “scrubbing the stair, the stairwell with a toothbrush, me and this other girl.<!-- page 112 -->
Like, I don’t remember what I did wrong, but that was something that I won’t forget.<!-- page 112 -->
I remember sitting on the steps, and she, our supervisor was standing there, watching us.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^426</a><!-- page 112 -->
Former students also spoke of how, in winter, they might be forced to stand or sit, inadequately clothed, in the snow as a form of punishment.<!-- page 112 --></p>
<p>It was not uncommon for residential school students, traumatized by being placed in such a harsh and alien environment, to wet their beds.<!-- page 112 -->
These students were subjected to humiliating punishments.<!-- page 112 -->
Wendy Lafond said that at the Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, school, “if we wet our beds, we were made to stand in the corner in our pissy clothes, not allowed to change.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^427</a><!-- page 112 -->
Don Willie recalled that students who wet their beds were publicly humiliated at the Alert Bay school.<!-- page 112 -->
“And they used to, they used to line up the wet bed, bedwetters, and line them up in the morning, and parade them through, parade them through breakfast, the breakfast area, pretty much to shame them.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^428</a><!-- page 112 --></p>
<p>Policies that were seen as being unacceptable in the early twentieth century were still in place in the 1960s.<!-- page 112 -->
Many students compared residential schools to jails: some spoke of being locked up in dormitories, broom closets, basements, and even crawl spaces.<!-- page 112 -->
In 1965, students who ran away from the Presbyterian school in Kenora were locked up with just a mattress on the floor and put on a bread-and-milk diet.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^429</a><!-- page 112 -->
Students were still being locked up in what was referred to as the “counselling” room at the Poplar Hill, Ontario, school in the 1980s.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^430</a><!-- page 112 -->
Despite the fact that Indian Affairs had given orders to abandon the practice, students were still having their hair cropped into the 1970s.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^431</a><!-- page 112 -->
In the 1990s, students at the Gordon’s, Saskatchewan, school were still being struck, and pushed into lockers and walls by one staff member.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^432</a><!-- page 112 --></p>
<p>The failure to develop, implement, and monitor effective discipline sent an unspoken message that there were no real limits on what could be done to Aboriginal children within the walls of a residential school.<!-- page 113 -->
The door had been opened early to an appalling level of physical and sexual abuse of students, and it remained open throughout the existence of the system.<!-- page 113 --></p>
</section><section class="section2" id="abuse-and-he-did-awful-things-to-me"><h2><a class="toclink" href="#abuse-and-he-did-awful-things-to-me">Abuse: “And he did awful things to me.”<!-- page 113 --></a></h2>
<p>From the nineteenth century onwards, the government and churches were well aware of the risk that staff might sexually abuse residential school students.<!-- page 113 -->
As early as 1886, Jean L’Heureux, who worked as a translator for Indian Affairs and a recruiter for Roman Catholic schools in Alberta, was accused of sexually abusing boys in his care.<!-- page 113 -->
The officials responsible for the schools recognized that his actions were not appropriate.<!-- page 113 -->
Despite this, there is no record of a criminal investigation being carried out at the time.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^433</a><!-- page 113 -->
When new allegations against L’Heureux emerged in 1891, he was allowed to resign.<!-- page 113 -->
In dealing with the matter, Indian Affairs Deputy Minister Lawrence Vankoughnet hoped “it would not be necessary to state the cause which led to the same [the resignation].”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^434</a><!-- page 113 --></p>
<p>When it came to taking action on the abuse of Aboriginal children, early on, Indian Affairs and the churches placed their own interests ahead of the children in their care and then covered up that victimization.<!-- page 113 -->
It was cowardly behaviour.<!-- page 113 --></p>
<p>This set the tone for the way the churches and government would treat the sexual abuse of children for the entire history of the residential school system.<!-- page 113 -->
Complaints often were ignored.<!-- page 113 -->
In some cases where allegations were made against a school principal, the only measure that Indian Affairs took was to contact the principal.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^435</a><!-- page 113 -->
In at least one case, Indian Affairs officials worked with school officials to frustrate a police investigation into abuse at a school.<!-- page 113 -->
When attempting to return some runaway boys to the Kuper Island school in 1939, British Columbia Provincial Police officers concluded that there was good reason to believe the boys had run away because they were being sexually abused at the school.<!-- page 113 -->
The police launched an investigation and refused to return the boys to the school.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^436</a><!-- page 113 -->
When Indian Affairs officials finally investigated, they concluded that the allegations had merit.<!-- page 113 -->
However, to protect the school’s reputation, the local Indian Affairs official advised the suspected abusers to leave the province, allowing them to avoid prosecution.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^437</a><!-- page 113 -->
Nothing was done for the students who had been victimized or for their parents.<!-- page 113 --></p>
<p>These patterns persisted into the late twentieth century.<!-- page 113 -->
Officials continued to dismiss Aboriginal reports of abuse.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^438</a><!-- page 113 -->
In some cases, staff members were not fired, even after being convicted of assaulting a student.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^439</a><!-- page 113 -->
Complaints were improperly investigated.<!-- page 113 -->
For example, charges of sexual impropriety made against the principal of the Gordon’s school were investigated by a school staff member in 1956.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^440</a><!-- page 113 -->
Church officials failed to report cases of abuse to Indian Affairs, and Indian Affairs failed to report cases of abuse to families.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^441</a><!-- page 113 -->
It was not until 1968 that Indian Affairs began to compile and circulate a list of former staff members who were not to be hired at other schools without the approval of officials in Ottawa.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^442</a><!-- page 113 --><!-- page 114 -->
The churches and the government remained reluctant to take matters to the police.<!-- page 114 -->
As a result, prosecutions were rare.<!-- page 114 --></p>
<p><img alt="In 1939, Indian Affairs officials recommended that Kuper Island school staff suspected of sexually abusing students leave the province, allowing them to avoid prosecution. British Columbia Archives, pdp05505." src="image-autofix/page-114.jpg" /><!-- page 114 --></p>
<p>In the documents it has reviewed, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada has identified over forty-five successful convictions of former residential school staff members who sexually or physically abused students.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^443</a><!-- page 114 -->
Most of these prosecutions were the result of the determination of former students to see justice done.<!-- page 114 --></p>
<p>The full extent of the abuse that occurred in the schools is only now coming to light.<!-- page 114 -->
As of January 31, 2015, the Independent Assessment Process (IAP), established under the Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement (IRSSA) had received 37,951 claims for injuries resulting from physical and sexual abuse at residential schools.<!-- page 114 -->
The IAP is a mechanism to compensate former students for sexual and physical abuse experienced at the schools and the harms that arose from the assaults.<!-- page 114 -->
By the end of 2014, the IAP had resolved 30,939 of those claims, awarding $2,690,000 in compensation.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^444</a><!-- page 114 -->
The Common Experience Payment (CEP) established under IRSSA provided compensation to individuals who attended a school on the IRSSA’s approved list of schools.<!-- page 114 -->
The CEP recognized the claims of 78,748 former residential school students.<!-- page 114 -->
Although claims for compensation under the IAP could be made by non-residential school students who were abused at the schools, the vast majority of IAP claims were made by former residential school students.<!-- page 114 -->
The number of claims for compensation for abuse is equivalent to approximately 48% of the number of former students who were eligible to make such claims.<!-- page 114 -->
This number does not include those former students who died prior to May 2005.<!-- page 114 --></p>
<p>As the numbers demonstrate, the abuse of children was rampant.<!-- page 114 -->
From 1958, when it first opened, until 1979, there was never a year in which Grollier Hall in Inuvik did not employ at least one dormitory supervisor who would later be convicted for sexually abusing students at the school.<!-- page 114 --><!-- page 115 -->
Joseph Jean Louis Comeau, Martin Houston, George Maczynski, and Paul Leroux all worked at Grollier Hall during this period.<!-- page 115 -->
All were convicted of abusing Grollier Hall students.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^445</a><!-- page 115 -->
William Peniston Starr served as director of the Gordon’s, Saskatchewan, residence from 1968 until 1984.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^446</a><!-- page 115 -->
Prior to that, he worked at a series of schools in Alberta and Québec.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^447</a><!-- page 115 -->
In 1993, he was convicted of ten counts of sexually assaulting Gordon’s school students.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^448</a><!-- page 115 -->
Arthur Plint worked as a boys’ supervisor at the Alberni residential school for two five-year periods between 1948 and 1968.<!-- page 115 -->
In 1995, he pleaded guilty to eighteen counts of indecent assault.<!-- page 115 -->
In sentencing him to eleven years in jail, Justice D. A. Hogarth described Plint as “a sexual terrorist.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^449</a><!-- page 115 --></p>
<p>Physical abuse and sexual abuse often were intertwined.<!-- page 115 -->
Jean Pierre Bellemare, who attended the Amos, Québec, school, spoke for many students when he told the Commission that he had been subjected to “physical violence, verbal violence, touchings, everything that comes with it.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^450</a><!-- page 115 -->
Andrew Yellowback was “sexually, physically, emotionally, and mentally abused” at the Cross Lake, Manitoba, school for eight years.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^451</a><!-- page 115 -->
There was no single pattern of abuse: students of both sexes reported assaults from staff members of both the opposite sex and the same sex as themselves.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^452</a><!-- page 115 --></p>
<p>First-year students, traumatized by separation from their parents and the harsh and alien regime of the school, were particularly vulnerable to abusive staff members who sought to win their trust through what initially appeared to be simple kindness.<!-- page 115 -->
In some cases, this might involve little more than extra treats from the school canteen.<!-- page 115 -->
This favouritism, however, was often the prelude to a sexual assault that left the student scared and confused.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^453</a><!-- page 115 --></p>
<p>Many students spoke of having been raped at school.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^454</a><!-- page 115 -->
These were moments of terror.<!-- page 115 -->
Josephine Sutherland was cornered by one of the lay brothers in the Fort Albany school garage: “I couldn’t call for help, I couldn’t.<!-- page 115 -->
And he did awful things to me.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^455</a><!-- page 115 -->
Other students recalled being assaulted in the church confessional.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^456</a><!-- page 115 -->
A student in the change room would suddenly have a bag pulled over his head.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^457</a><!-- page 115 -->
The abuse could begin with an instruction to report to the shower room in the middle of the night or to take lunch to a staff member’s room.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^458</a><!-- page 115 -->
An abusive staff person might stalk a student, blocking her or his way, or grope a passing student.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^459</a><!-- page 115 -->
Female students spoke of how some staff members took advantage of their innocence, rubbing against them sexually while they were sitting on their laps.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^460</a><!-- page 115 -->
Abuse also took the form of voyeuristic humiliation: some staff insisted on watching the students shower.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^461</a><!-- page 115 --></p>
<p>Some dormitory supervisors used their authority to institute dormitory-wide systems of abuse.<!-- page 115 -->
Many students spoke of the fear and anxiety that spread across their dormitories in the evenings.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^462</a><!-- page 115 -->
They went to bed fearful that they might be called into the supervisor’s room.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^463</a><!-- page 115 -->
To protect themselves, some students attempted to never be alone.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^464</a><!-- page 115 -->
Older children sometimes sought to protect younger ones.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^465</a><!-- page 115 --></p>
<p>Most students came to school with little knowledge or understanding of sexual activity, let alone the types of sexual abuse to which they might be subjected.<!-- page 115 -->
Abuse left them injured, bewildered, and often friendless or subject to ridicule by other students.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^466</a><!-- page 115 --><!-- page 116 -->
Many students thought they were the only children being abused.<!-- page 116 -->
This confusion made it difficult for them to describe or report their abuse.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^467</a><!-- page 116 -->
Some were told they would face eternal damnation for speaking of what had been done to them.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^468</a><!-- page 116 --></p>
<p>Many students fought back against their far larger and more powerful assailants, especially as they got older and stronger.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^469</a><!-- page 116 -->
Some succeeded in forcing their tormentors to leave them alone.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^470</a><!-- page 116 -->
Many others, such as Lawrence Waquan, concluded that there was “nothing you can do.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^471</a><!-- page 116 -->
Some students ran away from school in an attempt to escape abuse.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^472</a><!-- page 116 -->
Others begged their parents not to return them to school after a break.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^473</a><!-- page 116 --></p>
<p>Some students never reported abuse for fear they would not be believed.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^474</a><!-- page 116 -->
Other students who did report abuse were told that they were to blame.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^475</a><!-- page 116 -->
In some cases, school officials took immediate action when abuse was reported to them, but the rarity of such actions is itself noteworthy.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^476</a><!-- page 116 -->
Former students spoke of how betrayed they felt when nothing was done about their complaints.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^477</a><!-- page 116 -->
Many simply felt too ashamed to ever speak of the abuse.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^478</a><!-- page 116 -->
Family members often refused to believe their children’s reports of abuse, intensifying their sense of isolation and pain.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^479</a><!-- page 116 -->
This was especially so within families that had adopted Christianity, and could not believe that the people of God looking after their children would ever do such things.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^480</a><!-- page 116 --></p>
<p>The impact of abuse was immediate and long-lasting.<!-- page 116 -->
It destroyed the students’ ability to function in the school, and led many to turn to self-destructive behaviours.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^481</a><!-- page 116 --></p>
<p>Staff abuse of children created conditions for the student abuse of other students.<!-- page 116 -->
Every school system has to deal with school bullies, student cliques, and inter-student conflict.<!-- page 116 -->
It is part of the socialization process.<!-- page 116 -->
Ideally, corrective lessons in how to treat others well are taught, as well as shown by example.<!-- page 116 -->
Residential school staff had a responsibility not only to model such behaviour, but also to protect students from being victimized.<!-- page 116 -->
In many cases, they failed to provide that protection.<!-- page 116 -->
Conflicts between students are not unique to residential schools, but they take on greater significance in a residential school setting where children cannot turn to adult family members for comfort, support, and redress.<!-- page 116 -->
The moral influences that a child’s home community can exert are also absent.<!-- page 116 -->
Instead, the children were left vulnerable and unprotected.<!-- page 116 -->
Residential schools failed to live up to their responsibility to protect students from being victimized by other students.<!-- page 116 --></p>
<p>Older or bigger students used force—or the threat of force—to establish their dominance over younger students.<!-- page 116 -->
In some cases, this dominance was used to coerce younger or smaller students to participate in sexual acts.<!-- page 116 -->
In other cases, bullies forced vulnerable students to turn over their treats, their food, or their money, or to steal on their behalf.<!-- page 116 -->
In addition, bullies might simply seek a measure of sadistic satisfaction from beating those who were weaker.<!-- page 116 -->
Bullies operated individually or in groups.<!-- page 116 -->
Such groups were often formed initially as a defensive response to the level of violence within the school, but, over time, would take on their own offensive characteristics.<!-- page 116 -->
Sometimes, such groups not only focused their anger and/or frustration on other students, but also sought to disrupt the general operation of the school.<!-- page 116 --><!-- page 117 -->
The fact that Catholic and Protestant church leaders continued to disparage one another’s religions throughout this period meant that conflicts between students could also take on religious overtones, particularly in communities with more than one residential school, such as Inuvik in the Northwest Territories.<!-- page 117 --></p>
<p>Student victimization of students was an element of the broader abusive and coercive nature of the residential school system.<!-- page 117 -->
Underfed, poorly housed, and starved for affection, students often formed groups based on age, community of origin, or First Nation.<!-- page 117 -->
Such groups gave students a measure of identity and status, but also provided protection to their members and dominated more vulnerable students.<!-- page 117 --></p>
<p>William Garson recalled that at the Elkhorn, Manitoba, school, “we were always like hiding in the corners; you know away from any abusement.<!-- page 117 -->
From other, older, from older, elder boys, students.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^482</a><!-- page 117 -->
Percy Thompson said that at the Hobbema school, “one bully used to come at me and he’d pretend he was going to talk to me and all of sudden hit me in the belly.<!-- page 117 -->
And of course I gag, gag, and he’d laugh his head off and, you know, to see me in such a predicament.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^483</a><!-- page 117 -->
Alice Ruperthouse spoke of “the cruelty of the other children” at the Amos, Québec, school.<!-- page 117 -->
“It was, you know, like in a jungle.<!-- page 117 -->
Like in a jungle, you don’t know what’s going to come out but you know you had to watch out.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^484</a><!-- page 117 -->
Albert Elias felt that the classroom at the Anglican school in Aklavik “was the safest place to be in ’cause that’s where nobody could beat me up.<!-- page 117 -->
I dreaded recesses and lunches and after school, I dreaded those times.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^485</a><!-- page 117 --></p>
<p>Bullying might start shortly after arrival.<!-- page 117 -->
In some schools, all new male students were put through a hazing.<!-- page 117 -->
Denis Morrison said that each new arrival at the Fort Frances school underwent a beating.<!-- page 117 -->
“They used to initiate you, like, they would beat the hell out of you, the other kids would.<!-- page 117 -->
It wasn’t anybody else, it was the other kids, the older ones, eh.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^486</a><!-- page 117 -->
Bob Baxter recalled that there were student gangs at the Sioux Lookout school.<!-- page 117 -->
He was beaten up and knifed on one occasion.<!-- page 117 -->
He had a vivid memory of people tying him to his bed and throwing hot water over him.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^487</a><!-- page 117 -->
Clara Quisess said that at the Fort Albany school in Ontario, older girls would threaten the younger ones with knives.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^488</a><!-- page 117 -->
Louisa Birote recalled that the girls at the La Tuque, Québec, school all formed themselves into hostile groups.<!-- page 117 -->
“We hated each other.<!-- page 117 -->
So, this little gang didn’t like the other gang.<!-- page 117 -->
That’s the way at the school, that’s what we were taught, fears, and we were scared, and I went to hide in what we called the junk room, the junk closet.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^489</a><!-- page 117 --></p>
<p>A lack of adequate supervision in the schools and residences meant that such domination could give rise to physical and sexual abuse.<!-- page 117 -->
The assaults ranged from being forced to kiss someone, to being forced to simulate a sex act, to being raped.<!-- page 117 -->
In some cases, victims were given small treats to encourage them to be silent; in other cases, they were told they would be killed if they reported the assault.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^490</a><!-- page 117 -->
Agnes Moses recalled being molested by older girls at a hostel in northern Canada.<!-- page 117 -->
“I never quite understood it, and it really wrecked my life, it wrecked my life as a mother, a wife, a woman, and sexuality was a real, it was a dirty word for us.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^491</a><!-- page 117 -->
The experience of being abused at a British Columbia school by a group of boys left Don Willie distrustful of most people.<!-- page 117 --><!-- page 118 -->
“The only, only friends I kept after that were my relatives.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^492</a><!-- page 118 --></p>
<p>Complaints were infrequent, as students had good reason not to report their abuse.<!-- page 118 -->
Some feared that bullies would retaliate if they were reported.<!-- page 118 -->
Others were ashamed of what had been done to them, and some did not fully understand what had been done to them.<!-- page 118 -->
Many students feared they would not be believed—or would be blamed for somehow bringing the abuse upon themselves.<!-- page 118 -->
Still others were further punished when they did tell.<!-- page 118 -->
So, rather than report the abuse, many students chose to fight back; to seek admission into a receptive group, where violence could be fought with violence; or to endure the pain in silence.<!-- page 118 -->
This victimization left many students feeling intensely betrayed, fearful, isolated, and bereft of home teachings and protection.<!-- page 118 -->
The betrayal by fellow students has contributed significantly to the schools’ long-term legacy of continuing division and distrust within Aboriginal communities.<!-- page 118 -->
The residential school system’s shameful inability to protect students from such victimization, even from among themselves, represents one of its most significant and least-understood failures.<!-- page 118 --></p>

<p>Many students stated that sports helped them make it through residential school.<!-- page 118 -->
Christina Kimball attended the Roman Catholic school near The Pas, where she experienced physical, sexual, and emotional abuse.<!-- page 118 -->
She believes that it was only through her involvement with sports that she survived.<!-- page 118 -->
“I was very sports-oriented.<!-- page 118 -->
I played baseball.<!-- page 118 -->
Well, we play baseball, and even hockey.<!-- page 118 -->
We had a hockey team.<!-- page 118 -->
That has benefited, benefited me in a way ’cause I loved playing sports.<!-- page 118 -->
Well, that’s one way, too.<!-- page 118 -->
I don’t know how I did it but I was pretty good in sports.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^493</a><!-- page 118 -->
Noel Starblanket said that at the Qu’Appelle school, “I had some good moments, in particular in the sports side, ’cause I really enjoyed sports.<!-- page 118 -->
I was quite athletic, and basically that’s what kept me alive, that’s what kept me going was the sports.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^494</a><!-- page 118 -->
At the Lestock school, Geraldine Shingoose took refuge in extracurricular activities.<!-- page 118 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the good things that I would do to try and get out of just the abuse was try to, I would join track-meet, try and be, and I was quite athletic in boarding school.<!-- page 118 -->
And I also joined the band, and I played a trombone.<!-- page 118 -->
And, and that was something that took me away from the school, and just to, it was a relief.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^495</a><!-- page 118 --></p>

<p>Paul Andrew spent seven years at Grollier Hall in Inuvik.<!-- page 118 -->
One of his strongest and most positive memories related to school sports.<!-- page 118 -->
“There were times when I felt dumb and stupid.<!-- page 118 -->
But put me in a gym, there was not too many people better than I am.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^496</a><!-- page 118 --></p>
<p>Recreational activities were always underfunded and undersupplied at the schools.<!-- page 118 -->
A national survey of Indian Affairs schools (both day and residential) in 1956 concluded:<!-- page 118 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In most of the schools there appeared to be little or no physical education program.<!-- page 119 -->
A number of schools had no facilities for such activities.<!-- page 119 -->
Basement areas were obviously designed for playing areas, but they were very inadequate and were utilized for storage or for assembly purposes.<!-- page 119 -->
A large number of school sites were not properly cleared, graded, and prepared for playing purposes.<!-- page 119 -->
Many were still in the wild state; others were overgrown with shrubs, thistles, grasses and other weeds presenting a very unkempt and neglected appearance.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^497</a><!-- page 119 --></p>

<p>Oblate Provincial L. Poupore wrote to Indian Affairs about conditions at the Williams Lake, British Columbia, school in 1957.<!-- page 119 -->
He pointed out that a year and half earlier, he had informed Indian Affairs about the need for a school gymnasium.<!-- page 119 -->
At that time, he said, “The boys’ play room, a room about 35 by 60, was a scene of bedlam during recreation periods.<!-- page 119 -->
There were about 150 boys trying to play; the mud they had brought in on their feet had dried and there was so much dust in the room that you could not recognize a boy at the opposite end.”<!-- page 119 -->
Although the department had assured him the construction of a gymnasium would be a priority, nothing had been done, and “the problem of playroom space is worse than ever.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^498</a><!-- page 119 --></p>
<p>Despite the lack of financial support, hockey teams from a number of schools achieved considerable success in the 1940s and 1950s.<!-- page 119 -->
Teams from Duck Lake and Qu’Appelle in Saskatchewan, in particular, established enviable records.<!-- page 119 -->
The Duck Lake school team, the St. Michael’s Indians, won the championship of an eight-team league in the Rosthern area in 1946.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^499</a><!-- page 119 -->
In 1948, the same team, coached by Father G.-M. Latour, won the northern Saskatchewan midget hockey championship.<!-- page 119 --><!-- page 120 -->
The following year, it won the provincial championship.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^500</a><!-- page 120 -->
According to the Prince Albert Daily Herald, “While the Duck Lake boys were outweighed in their midget series they made it up in hockey know-how, skating ability and shooting accuracy.<!-- page 120 -->
Their drives, from any angle, had the Regina players scared and baffled at the same time.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^501</a><!-- page 120 -->
Among the players on the 1949 Duck Lake provincial championship team was Fred Sasakamoose, who went on to become the first status Indian to play in the National Hockey League.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^502</a><!-- page 120 --></p>

<p>While hockey dominated boys’ sports in most residential schools, British Columbia residential schools gained renown for their boxers.<!-- page 120 -->
In 1947, the Roman Catholic school at Sechelt in North Vancouver advertised for a volunteer to run a school athletics program.<!-- page 120 -->
Navy veteran Alex Strain took on the job.<!-- page 120 -->
At the time, the school had no recreation program and no facilities.<!-- page 120 -->
Under Strain’s direction, the students cleared out a storage building and turned it into a gymnasium.<!-- page 120 -->
Putting in four days of volunteer work a week, Strain created what Vancouver Sun reporter Gerry Pratt described as “the smoothest tumbling team in the province.”<!-- page 120 -->
He then established a boxing program at the school.<!-- page 120 -->
The limits of the first ring were marked out by four rows of chairs.<!-- page 120 -->
The first punching bag was a navy duffle bag filled with tumbling mats.<!-- page 120 -->
After two years, Strain purchased a used truck and took the students on a boxing tour of Vancouver Island.<!-- page 120 -->
After four years in existence, the team had won over 100 trophies.<!-- page 120 -->
Sister John Lawrence made robes and shorts for each member of the team and also served as trainer.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^503</a><!-- page 120 -->
Frederick Baker, the winner of the first national Tom Longboat award, was a member of the Sechelt boxing team.<!-- page 120 -->
Baker had won three championships in 1948, two in 1949, one in 1950, and one in 1951.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^504</a><!-- page 120 --><!-- page 121 --></p>

<p>Other students sought solace in the arts.<!-- page 121 -->
A number of former residential school students went on to prominent careers in the visual arts, including Alex Janvier, Jackson Beardy, Judith Morgan, and Norval Morrisseau.<!-- page 121 -->
Some, such as Beardy, were encouraged in their artistic endeavours by sympathetic staff.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^505</a><!-- page 121 -->
Like sports, cultural activities were underfunded.<!-- page 121 -->
They were also often intended to encourage assimilation.<!-- page 121 -->
In 1967, the students attending the Shingwauk, Ontario, school put on a four-act play called <em>Arrow to the Moon</em>.<!-- page 121 -->
One act used a dialogue between an Elder and a young man to contrast what were seen as the old and new ways open to Aboriginal people.<!-- page 121 -->
Billy Diamond played the role of the young man, who concludes at the scene’s end, “The new ways show a way to work and live but the old ways have shown us how to die.”<!-- page 121 -->
The performance was filmed and shown to the James Bay Cree, who refrained from making any public comment, but were shocked to discover the degree to which their children were being manipulated.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^506</a><!-- page 121 --></p>
<p>Albert Canadien recalled in his memoirs from Akaitcho Hall:<!-- page 121 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A few of the boys had guitars and there were other instruments in the common room.<!-- page 121 -->
Sometimes, a few of the boys would get together and play to pass the time.<!-- page 121 -->
John, the boys’ supervisor, noticed this was going on and took an interest, encouraging us to play and sing.<!-- page 121 --></p>
<p>At first we got together just for fun.<!-- page 121 -->
But eventually …<!-- page 121 -->
we formed a band.<!-- page 121 -->
There were five or six of us, and we call ourselves the Arctic Ramblers.<!-- page 121 -->
We had guitars, fiddle, bass guitar, drums, and there was even a piano for a while.<!-- page 121 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>They played at dances at the residence and in Hay River.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^507</a><!-- page 121 -->
Canadien went on to play in the Chieftones, a rock-and-roll band that toured extensively across North America.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^508</a><!-- page 121 --></p>
<p>On the rinks, the athletic fields, and parade grounds, or in the arts and handicraft rooms and on performance stages, many students found a way to express themselves, and, through that, gained the opportunity to explore their own talents and sometimes other parts of the country or the world.<!-- page 121 -->
Most importantly, they gained some confidence in their ability to achieve.<!-- page 121 --></p>

<p>Parents and children developed a variety of strategies to resist residential schooling.<!-- page 122 -->
Parents might refuse to enrol students, refuse to return runaways, or they might refuse to return students to school at the end of the summer holidays.<!-- page 122 -->
They also called on the government to increase school funding; to establish day schools in their home communities; and to improve the quality of education, food, and clothing.<!-- page 122 -->
In taking such measures, they often put themselves at risk of legal reprisals.<!-- page 122 -->
Almost invariably, the system declined to accept the validity of parental and student criticisms.<!-- page 122 -->
Parental influences were judged by school and government officials to be negative and backward.<!-- page 122 -->
The schools also suspected parents of encouraging their children in acts of disobedience.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^509</a><!-- page 122 -->
Once parents came to be viewed as the ‘enemy,’ their criticisms, no matter how valid, could be discounted.<!-- page 122 --></p>
<p>Prior to 1920, when the <em>Indian Act</em> was amended to allow Indian Affairs to compel children to attend residential school, the most effective form of resistance that parents could make was to simply refuse to enrol their children.<!-- page 122 -->
This measure was so effective that it contributed to the closure of a number of residential schools.<!-- page 122 -->
The Battleford, Saskatchewan, school, which had a capacity of 150 students, had an enrolment of thirty-five in 1915.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^510</a><!-- page 122 -->
The school was closed two years later.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^511</a><!-- page 122 -->
The High River, Alberta, school could also hold over 100 students, but by 1922, the year it closed, the school had an enrolment of only forty.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^512</a><!-- page 122 -->
The Middlechurch, Manitoba, school was not rebuilt after it burned down in 1906, in large measure because it could not recruit enough students.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^513</a><!-- page 122 -->
For similar reasons, the St. Boniface, Manitoba, school closed in 1905; the Calgary, Alberta, school closed in 1907; the Regina, Saskatchewan, school closed in 1910; the Elkhorn, Manitoba, school closed in 1919; and the Red Deer, Alberta, school closed in 1919.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^514</a><!-- page 122 --></p>
<p>By refusing to enrol their children in the industrial schools on the Prairies, parents not only undermined the federal government’s assimilation policies, but also deprived the schools of per capita grant revenue and student labour.<!-- page 122 -->
As a result, the industrial schools ran significant deficits, and overworked and underfed the children they did recruit.<!-- page 122 -->
This led other parents to withdraw their children from the schools.<!-- page 122 -->
This was never a risk-free choice for parents.<!-- page 122 -->
Often, residential schools were the only available schools.<!-- page 122 -->
Parents who wished to see their children schooled had few, if any, options.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^515</a><!-- page 122 --></p>
<p>Sometimes, government officials also took reprisals against parents who kept their children out of school, in some cases denying them food rations and Treaty payments.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^516</a><!-- page 122 -->
Parents continued to keep their children out of school well into the twentieth century: in 1941, only forty-five students were enrolled in the Fort Providence school, which had an authorized attendance of 100.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^517</a><!-- page 122 --></p>
<p>In at least one instance, parents home-schooled their children.<!-- page 122 -->
In 1941, Muriel, Doreen, and Kathleen Steinhauer were kept home from the Edmonton residential school because their parents were not satisfied with the progress they were making at the school.<!-- page 122 -->
Their mother, Isabel, had been a schoolteacher prior to her marriage, and home-schooled the children.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^518</a><!-- page 122 --><!-- page 123 --></p>

In 1904, a husband and wife attempted to remove their daughter from the Kuper Island school.<!-- page 123 -->
When Principal G. Donckele informed them that when they signed the admission form, they had given the government the right to determine when their daughter would be discharged, the father said, “I am the father of this child and I do not care for what you and the government have to say about it.”<!-- page 123 -->
After being told that he could be prosecuted, the father left with his daughter anyway.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^519</a><!-- page 123 --></p>
<p>In 1913, when a mother removed her daughter from the Fort Resolution school, the Mounted Police were called in and the mother surrendered the girl to the school.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^520</a><!-- page 123 -->
In response to the death of a student in 1922, local parents withdrew their children from the Kitamaat, British Columbia, residential school.<!-- page 123 -->
They agreed to return them only on the condition that the principal “sign her name to a paper before us that she would see that the children got all the food they wanted, that they would be well cared for, and be supplied with sufficient clothing.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^521</a><!-- page 123 --></p>
<p>In March 1948, the principal of the Roman Catholic school at Cardston, Alberta, struck a father who was attempting to take his son out of the school.<!-- page 123 -->
In discussing the issue with Indian Affairs, the Blood Indian Council insisted on having the record note that this was “not the first time that Father Charron had hit an Indian.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^522</a><!-- page 123 --></p>
<p>It was not uncommon for the parents of an entire community or region to refuse to return their children to school.<!-- page 124 -->
In the fall of 1926, for example, parents from communities in Manitoba’s Interlake region announced they were not sending their children back to the Elkhorn school.<!-- page 124 -->
According to the parents, the children were not well fed, the older boys compelled the younger boys to steal, and all children were poorly clothed.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^523</a><!-- page 124 -->
In October 1927, seventy-five school-aged children from the Blood Reserve in Alberta either had not returned to school or had not been enrolled in school.<!-- page 124 -->
It took a letter from the police, plus a follow-up visit from the Indian agent, to fill the Anglican and Catholic schools on the reserve.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^524</a><!-- page 124 -->
Two weeks after the start of the 1940 school year, fifty-four students had yet to return to the Fraser Lake, British Columbia, school.<!-- page 124 -->
The police were called in, and by October 2, twenty-five of the students had been returned.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^525</a><!-- page 124 -->
This form of parental action was common throughout the 1940s.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^526</a><!-- page 124 --></p>
<p>Parents were eager to have their children properly educated, and often proposed realistic and effective solutions.<!-- page 124 -->
In 1905, parents of children attending the Roman Catholic boarding school in Squamish, British Columbia, petitioned to have the school converted into an industrial school.<!-- page 124 -->
The request was not granted, despite the fact that Indian Affairs officials recognized that the boarding school grant allowed for only “the bare necessities in the line of food and clothing.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^527</a><!-- page 124 --></p>
<p>Some First Nations leaders who had originally supported residential schools later publicly regretted their decision.<!-- page 124 -->
Chief Napahkesit of the Pine Creek Band in Manitoba said in 1917 that he was sorry he had ever supported the construction of the Pine Creek school.<!-- page 124 -->
According to the local Indian agent, the chief felt “the children know less when they come out than they did when they went in.”<!-- page 124 -->
What was needed, the chief said, was a day school.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^528</a><!-- page 124 -->
Calls for day schools were, in fact, a common parental request.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^529</a><!-- page 124 -->
A 1949 call from parents for a day school at the Cowessess Reserve eventually proved to be successful.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^530</a><!-- page 124 --></p>
<p>Parents might also demand the dismissal of a principal.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^531</a><!-- page 124 -->
In 1917, to back up their call for the resignation of the Shoal Lake school principal, parents refused to return their children to the school.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^532</a><!-- page 124 -->
In this case, the principal did resign.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^533</a><!-- page 124 -->
The parents of the Kahkewistahaw Band unsuccessfully petitioned the federal government to remove a teacher from the Round Lake, Saskatchewan, school in July 1949.<!-- page 124 -->
They said that “the children’s report cards are very unsatisfactory, worst ever received, and she abuses the children too much.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^534</a><!-- page 124 -->
Parents also complained that their children were not learning the skills they needed to survive.<!-- page 124 -->
Chief Kejick of the Shoal Lake Band told Indian Affairs officials in 1928 that the students from his reserve “did not know how to make a living when they left school and would like trades taught.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^535</a><!-- page 124 -->
Eight years later, Charlie Shingoose of the Waywayseecappo Band sought to have his fifteen-year-old son discharged from the Birtle school so he could teach him to “work, trap, etc.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^536</a><!-- page 124 --></p>
<p>Parents also hired lawyers to press their cases for investigations into the deaths of children who had run away, to complain about the harshness of discipline, to advocate on behalf of children who had been injured working at the schools, and to attempt to have their children discharged from school.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^537</a><!-- page 124 --><!-- page 125 --></p>
<p>One of the more unusual protests was mounted by First Nations people (Dene) in the Northwest Territories, who, in 1937, refused to accept their Treaty payments in protest of conditions at the Fort Resolution school.<!-- page 125 -->
Their children, they said, were “living in hell.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^538</a><!-- page 125 --></p>
<p>Residential schools also came under criticism from early First Nations organizations.<!-- page 125 -->
At its meeting in Saddle Lake, Alberta, in 1931, the League of Indians of Canada called for the construction of more day schools to augment residential schools.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^539</a><!-- page 125 -->
The following year, the league, by then known as the League of Indians of Western Canada, called for the closure of boarding schools.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^540</a><!-- page 125 -->
The league also recommended that only qualified teachers be hired to work at residential schools, that medical examinations be given to students before they were sent to the schools, and that the half-day system be changed to allow for greater class time.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^541</a><!-- page 125 --></p>
<p>In an effort to bring their own residential schooling to an end, some students attempted to burn their schools down.<!-- page 125 -->
There were at least thirty-seven such attempts, two of which ended in student and staff deaths.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^542</a><!-- page 125 -->
For students, the most effective form of resistance was to run away.<!-- page 125 -->
The principal of the Shingwauk Home in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, school in the 1870s, E. F. Wilson, devoted a chapter of his memoirs to the topic of “Runaway Boys.”<!-- page 125 -->
It included the story of three boys who tried to make their way home by boat.<!-- page 125 -->
They were found alive more than ten days later, stranded on an island in the North Channel of Lake Huron.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^543</a><!-- page 125 --></p>
<p>After 1894, children enrolled in a residential school (or who had been placed there by government order because it was felt that they were not being properly cared for by their parents) but who were refusing to show up at school were considered to be “truant.”<!-- page 125 -->
Under the <em>Indian Act</em> and its regulations, they could be returned to the school against their will.<!-- page 125 -->
Children who ran away from residential schools were also considered to be truants.<!-- page 125 -->
Parents who supported their children in their truancy were often threatened with prosecution.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^544</a><!-- page 125 --></p>
<p>Most runaway students headed for their home communities.<!-- page 125 -->
Students knew they might be caught, returned, and punished.<!-- page 125 -->
Still, they believed the effort to make it home and have a measure of freedom was worth it.<!-- page 125 -->
In some cases, in fact, the schools failed to force runaways to return.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^545</a><!-- page 125 -->
Some students eluded capture.<!-- page 125 -->
Instead of heading home, some went to work for local farmers and, as a result, were able to avoid their pursuers for considerable periods of time.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^546</a><!-- page 125 --></p>
<p>Running away could be risky.<!-- page 125 -->
At least thirty-three students died, usually due to exposure, after running away from school.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^547</a><!-- page 125 -->
In a significant number of cases, parents and Indian Affairs officials concluded that the deaths could have been prevented if school officials had mounted earlier and more effective searches and notified police officials and family members.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^548</a><!-- page 125 -->
In the case of Charles and Tom Ombash, two brothers who ran away from the Sioux Lookout school on October 5, 1956, school officials waited until November before informing police or Indian Affairs.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^549</a><!-- page 125 --><!-- page 126 -->
The boys were never found—community members continued to search for their remains decades after their disappearance.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^550</a><!-- page 126 --></p>
<p><img alt="Boys cutting wood at the Williams Lake, British Columbia, school in either the late nineteenth or early twentieth century. In February 1902 Duncan Sticks froze to death after running away from the school. Museum of the Cariboo Chilcotin." src="image-autofix/page-126.jpg" /><!-- page 126 --></p>
<p>These deaths date back to the beginning of the twentieth century.<!-- page 126 -->
However, the first system-wide policy outlining the procedures to be taken when a child ran away from school that the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada has located in the documents it has reviewed dates from 1953.<!-- page 126 -->
This was seventy-five years after the government began its residential school system.<!-- page 126 -->
That policy simply stated, “The principal shall take prompt action to effect the return to school of any truant pupil, and shall report promptly to the Superintendent, Indian Agency, every case of truancy.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^551</a><!-- page 126 -->
The nature of the prompt action was undefined.<!-- page 126 -->
In particular, there was no requirement to contact either the child’s parents or the police.<!-- page 126 -->
It was not until 1971 that a more encompassing, nation-wide, policy was announced.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^552</a><!-- page 126 --></p>
<p>In pursuing children to their parents’ homes, the actions of school employees could be both invasive and disrespectful.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^553</a><!-- page 126 -->
In the town of Lebret, Saskatchewan, “all the houses were checked” by the police as part of a search for two runaways from the File Hills school in 1935.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^554</a><!-- page 126 --></p>
<p>Running away was not in itself a crime.<!-- page 126 -->
However, most students were wearing school-issued clothing when they ran away, and, in some cases, principals tried, and even succeeded, in having them prosecuted for stealing the clothing they were wearing.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^555</a><!-- page 126 -->
Students who ran away numerous times also could be charged under the <em>Juvenile Delinquents Act</em>.<!-- page 126 --><!-- page 127 -->
In such cases, they could be sentenced to a reformatory until they turned twenty-one.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^556</a><!-- page 127 --></p>
<p>The 1894 <em>Indian Act</em> amendments made parents who did not return truants to school subject to prosecution.<!-- page 127 -->
The Mounted Police were often called in to force parents to send their children to school.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^557</a><!-- page 127 -->
The Blue Quills, Alberta, school journal entry for May 1, 1932, reads: “The savages having received the order to bring their children to school unless they want the police to get involved, some parents did obey the order today.<!-- page 127 -->
But there are still those who turn a deaf ear.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^558</a><!-- page 127 -->
In 1937, a father who refused to return his son to the Sandy Bay, Manitoba, school was sentenced to ten days in jail.<!-- page 127 -->
To prevent him from running away again, the boy was sent to a school in Saskatchewan.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^559</a><!-- page 127 --></p>
<p>Parents were often outraged at having to return runaways.<!-- page 127 -->
Wallace Hahawahi’s father was reported as being “very indignant” at the prospect of sending his son back to the Brandon school in 1936.<!-- page 127 -->
The boy was over sixteen and needed to help out at home.<!-- page 127 -->
In this case, the father’s argument prevailed and the boy was discharged.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^560</a><!-- page 127 -->
Another runaway from the same school, Kenneth Thompson, told the police, “I am a Treaty Indian of Assiniboine Indian Reserve, I am 17 year of Age.<!-- page 127 -->
I wish to state the reason I ran away from school was because I have to work too hard in fact I do not study at all.<!-- page 127 -->
I am working around the school all the time.<!-- page 127 -->
I consider if I have to work I may as well work at home for my father.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^561</a><!-- page 127 -->
Despite his argument, he was returned to the school.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^562</a><!-- page 127 --></p>
<p>Indian agents often referred to ongoing truancy issues at specific schools as “epidemics.”<!-- page 127 -->
The agents viewed such epidemics as a sign of underlying problems at a school.<!-- page 127 -->
In 1928, Indian agent J. Waddy wrote that at the Anglican school in The Pas, “hardly a day goes bye [sic] that one or more do not take leave on their own account.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^563</a><!-- page 127 -->
In 1935, ten pupils ran away from the Birtle, Manitoba, school.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^564</a><!-- page 127 -->
In the closing years of the 1930s, the Shubenacadie school in Nova Scotia experienced continual truancy problems.<!-- page 127 -->
It was not uncommon for some students to make numerous attempts to leave the school.<!-- page 127 -->
On the morning of July 7, 1937, Andrew Julian decided not to join the other boys assigned to milk the school’s dairy herd.<!-- page 127 -->
Instead, he headed for Truro, where he was reported as being sighted in the rail yard.<!-- page 127 -->
He was not located until the end of the month.<!-- page 127 -->
By then, he had made it to Nyanza in Cape Breton, a distance of 260 miles (418.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^4</a><!-- page 127 -->
kilometres) from the school.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^565</a><!-- page 127 -->
The following year, Steven Labobe (also given as LaBobe) managed to make it back to his home on Prince Edward Island.<!-- page 127 -->
The principal decided not to demand the boy’s return.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^566</a><!-- page 127 -->
Other boys were not so lucky.<!-- page 127 -->
One boy, who ran away five times, was eventually placed in a private reformatory.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^567</a><!-- page 127 --></p>
<p>Many students said they ran away to escape the discipline of the school.<!-- page 127 -->
Ken Lacquette attended residential schools in Brandon and Portage la Prairie, Manitoba.<!-- page 127 -->
“They used to give us straps all the time with our pants down they’d give us straps right in the public.<!-- page 127 -->
Then …<!-- page 127 -->
this started happening, after awhile when I was getting old enough I started taking off from there, running away.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^568</a><!-- page 127 -->
Others were seeking to escape something far more sinister than corporal punishment.<!-- page 127 --><!-- page 128 -->
After being subjected to ongoing sexual abuse, Anthony Wilson ran away from the Alberni school.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^569</a><!-- page 128 --></p>
<p>In the 1940s, Arthur McKay regularly ran away from the Sandy Bay school.<!-- page 128 -->
“I didn’t even know where my home was, the first time right away.<!-- page 128 -->
But these guys are the ones; my friends were living in nearby reserve, what they call Ebb and Flow, that’s where they were going so I followed.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^570</a><!-- page 128 -->
Ivan George and a group of his friends ran away from the Mission, British Columbia, school when he was eleven years old.<!-- page 128 -->
They were strapped on their return.<!-- page 128 -->
Despite this, he ran away two more times that school year.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^571</a><!-- page 128 --></p>
<p>Muriel Morrisseau ran away from the Fort Alexander school almost every year she was at the school.<!-- page 128 -->
The experience was often frightening.<!-- page 128 -->
“I remember running away again trying to cross the river and it started freezing up, we all got scared, we had to come back again with a tail under our legs.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^572</a><!-- page 128 -->
Isaac Daniels ran away from the Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, school with two older boys.<!-- page 128 -->
Their escape route involved crossing a railway bridge.<!-- page 128 -->
Partway across, Daniels became too frightened to continue and turned back.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^573</a><!-- page 128 -->
Dora Necan ran away from the Fort Frances school with a friend.<!-- page 128 -->
They made it to the United States and stayed there for three days before returning to the school.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^574</a><!-- page 128 -->
Nellie Cournoyea was sheltered by Aboriginal families along her route when she ran away from an Anglican hostel in the Northwest Territories after a confrontation with a teacher.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^575</a><!-- page 128 -->
When Lawrence Waquan ran away from the Fort Chipewyan school in 1965, there were no roads and no one along the way to support him.<!-- page 128 -->
“I walked from Fort Chipewyan in northern Alberta to Fort Smith, 130 miles.<!-- page 128 -->
It took me about five days.<!-- page 128 -->
I was only about sixteen.<!-- page 128 -->
And I just ate berries and drank water to survive.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^576</a><!-- page 128 --></p>
<p>When Beverley Anne Machelle and her friends ran away from the Lytton, British Columbia, school, they had to contend with the school’s isolated and mountainous location.<!-- page 128 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>It was halfway down this big hill, and then from there you could see town.<!-- page 128 -->
And we got halfway down there, and we were all feeling, like, woo-hoo, you know, and we got out of there, and, and we’re gonna go do something fun, and, and then we got halfway down, and then we realized, well, we have no money, and we have no place to go.<!-- page 128 -->
There was no place to go.<!-- page 128 -->
There was no safe place to go.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^577</a><!-- page 128 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The girls at the Sioux Lookout school rebelled in 1955 when they were all sent to bed early after a number of girls had been caught stealing.<!-- page 128 -->
They barricaded themselves in their dormitory and refused to allow any staff to enter.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^578</a><!-- page 128 -->
There was a similar revolt in Edmonton in the 1960s, when students blocked staff entry to the dormitory at night, to protest the abuse of students.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^579</a><!-- page 128 --></p>
<p>Collectively and individually, parents and students did resist the residential school attack on Aboriginal families and communities.<!-- page 128 -->
On occasion, they won small victories: a child might be discharged; a day school might be built.<!-- page 128 -->
However, as long as Aboriginal people were excluded from positions of control over their children’s education, the root causes of the conflict remained unresolved.<!-- page 128 --></p>
<p><img alt="Staff outside the entrance of the Brandon, Manitoba, school in 1946. National Film Board of Canada. Photothèque, Library and Archives Canada, PA-048575." src="image-autofix/page-129.jpg" /><!-- page 129 --></p>
<section class="section3" id="the-staff-my-aim-was-to-do-something-good"><h3><a class="toclink" href="#the-staff-my-aim-was-to-do-something-good">The staff: “My aim was to do something good.”<!-- page 129 --></a></h3>
<p>For most of their history, residential schools were staffed by individuals who were recruited by Christian missionary organizations.<!-- page 129 -->
Generally, the churches appointed a priest or minister, as opposed to an educator, as the principal.<!-- page 129 -->
The Roman Catholic schools could draw staff from a number of Catholic religious orders, whose members had made explicit vows of obedience, poverty, and chastity.<!-- page 129 -->
In the spirit of those vows, they would be obliged to go where they were sent, would not expect payment, and would have no families to support.<!-- page 129 -->
Indian Commissioner David Laird believed that since members of Roman Catholic religious orders received very little in exchange for their services, the Roman Catholic schools could “afford to have a much larger staff than where ordinary salaries are paid, and there is consequently less work for each to do, without interfering with the quality of the work done.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^580</a><!-- page 129 -->
The Protestant schools recruited many of their staff members through missionary organizations.<!-- page 129 --></p>
<p>Many of the early school staff members believed they were participating in a moral crusade.<!-- page 129 -->
In her history of the McDougall Orphanage, the predecessor of the Morley school in Alberta, Mrs. J. McDougall described the work of the mission and orphanage as “going out after the wild and ignorant and bringing them into a Christian home and blessing the body, culturing the mind and trying to raise spiritual vision.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^581</a><!-- page 129 --></p>
<p>Staff members were often motivated by a spirit of adventure as well as a religious commitment.<!-- page 130 -->
As a young seminary student in Corsica, a French island in the Mediterranean, Nicolas Coccola wanted more than a life as a priest.<!-- page 130 -->
In his memoir, he wrote, “The desire of foreign missions with the hope of martyrdom appeared to me as a higher calling.”<!-- page 130 -->
He ended up living out his life as a residential school principal in British Columbia.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^582</a><!-- page 130 -->
As a small boy in England in the middle of the nineteenth century, Gibbon Stocken read with enthusiasm the missionary literature sent to him by an aunt.<!-- page 130 -->
When he turned seventeen, he volunteered his services to the Anglican Church Missionary Society.<!-- page 130 -->
He hoped to be sent to India.<!-- page 130 -->
Instead, he was offered a position on the Blackfoot Reserve in what is now southern Alberta.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^583</a><!-- page 130 -->
British-born nurse and midwife Margaret Butcher managed to get to India, where she worked for a British family.<!-- page 130 -->
From there, she made her way to British Columbia, where she worked with a Methodist mission to Japanese immigrants.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^584</a><!-- page 130 -->
In 1916, she was on her way to a job at the Methodist residential school in Kitamaat, British Columbia.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^585</a><!-- page 130 --></p>
<p>This mix of motivations continued throughout the system’s history.<!-- page 130 -->
Lorraine Arbez, who worked at the Qu’Appelle school in the 1950s, said, “I chose this career to work with the children and my aim was to do something good with them and I hope I was of some use.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^586</a><!-- page 130 -->
For Noreen Fischbuch, who worked at schools in Ontario and Alberta in the 1950s and 1960s, the residential schools offered much-needed experience: “As far as I was concerned, it was a teaching job, it was with the kids and I liked the kids…<!-- page 130 -->
The kids were getting an education; I had a job.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^587</a><!-- page 130 -->
George Takashima, who taught at Sioux Lookout, explained, “I was just sort of adventuresome, you might say.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^588</a><!-- page 130 --></p>
<p>Almost all the staff members were poorly paid.<!-- page 130 -->
Government officials took the position that because many of the staff members belonged to missionary organizations, pay was a “minor consideration.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^589</a><!-- page 130 -->
As a result, the schools had problems recruiting and keeping staff.<!-- page 130 -->
Alexander Sutherland of the Methodist Church was particularly outspoken about the link between low wages and the difficulties the schools had in recruiting staff.<!-- page 130 -->
In 1887, he wrote to the minister of Indian Affairs about the “difficulty of obtaining efficient and properly qualified teachers, on account of the meagre salaries paid.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^590</a><!-- page 130 -->
The issue of low pay never went away.<!-- page 130 -->
More than half a century later, in 1948, C. H. Birdsall, the chair of the United Church committee responsible for the Edmonton school, complained that it “is impossible for the Residential School to offer salaries in competition with” rates that Indian Affairs was paying teachers at day schools.<!-- page 130 -->
Given the inadequate quality of accommodation, equipment, and staff at the school, he felt that it was “doubtful the present work with Indian Children could properly be called education.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^591</a><!-- page 130 -->
Many of the Catholic schools survived on what amounted to volunteer labour.<!-- page 130 -->
In 1948, Sechelt principal H. F. Dunlop informed Ottawa, “If this school kept out of the red during the past year it was largely due to the fact that four Oblates, working here full time, received in salaries from Jan 1947 to Jan 1948 the grand total of $1800.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^592</a><!-- page 130 -->
As late as 1960, the nuns at the Christie Island school were being paid $50 a month—a fact that made Principal A. Noonan “feel like a heel.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^593</a><!-- page 130 --></p>
<p><img alt="The chief cook at Lapointe Hall in Fort Simpson, Northwest Territories. The schools were highly dependent on female labour. Northwest Territories Archives, N-1992-255-0144." src="image-autofix/page-131.jpg" /><!-- page 131 --></p>
<p>Many qualified and experienced people worked in the schools. Miss Asson, the matron at the Kitamaat school in 1930, was a graduate of the Ensworth Deaconess Hospital in St. Joseph, Missouri. She had also trained as a deaconess in Toronto, and worked in China from 1909 to 1927.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^594</a> The matron at the Anglican Wabasca, Alberta, school in 1933 was a nurse.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^595</a> Among the staff at the Norway House school in the early twentieth century were the sisters Charlotte Amelia and Lilian Yeomans. Charlotte had trained as a nurse, and Lilian was one of the first women in Canada to qualify as a doctor.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^596</a> Theresa Reid had four years of teaching experience and a teaching certificate before she applied to work at Norway House,<a href="footnote-placeholder">^597</a> George Takashima had a teaching certificate,<a href="footnote-placeholder">^598</a> and Olive Saunders had a university degree and several years of teaching experience.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^599</a> In 1966, E. O. Drouin, the principal of the Roman Catholic school in Cardston, boasted that out of the twenty-one people on his staff, ten had university degrees. Drouin, himself, had left his position as a university professor to go to work at the school.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^600</a><!-- page 131 --></p>
<p>A number of people devoted their adult lives to working in residential schools.<!-- page 131 -->
At least twelve principals died in office.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^601</a><!-- page 131 -->
Kuper Island principal George Donckele resigned in January 1907; by June of that year, he was dead.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^602</a><!-- page 131 -->
Sherman Shepherd served at the Anglican schools in Shingle Point on the Arctic Ocean in the Yukon, Aklavik (Northwest Territories), Fort George (Québec), and Moose Factory (Ontario), resigning in 1954 after twenty-five years of service in northern Canada.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^603</a><!-- page 131 -->
Others worked into their old age, since, due to low pay, their savings were also low and pensions were minimal.<!-- page 131 -->
When the seventy-three-year-old matron of the Ahousaht school in British Columbia retired in 1929, Principal W. M. Wood recommended that she be given an honorarium of a month’s salary as appreciation for her years of service.<!-- page 131 -->
Woods noted that she was “retiring with very limited means.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^604</a><!-- page 131 --></p>
<p>Such long service was not the norm.<!-- page 131 -->
Because the pay was often low and the working and living conditions were difficult, turnover was high throughout the system’s history.<!-- page 131 -->
From 1882 to 1894, there was what amounted to an annual full turnover of teachers at the Fort Simpson (now Port Simpson), British Columbia, school.<!-- page 131 -->
At one point, all the teaching was being done by the local Methodist missionary Thomas Crosby, his wife, Emma, and the school matron.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^605</a><!-- page 131 --><!-- page 132 -->
Between January 1958 and March 1960, a period of just over two years, the Alert Bay school lost fifty-eight staff members.<!-- page 132 -->
Of these, nineteen had been fired because they were deemed to be incompetent.<!-- page 132 -->
Eight others left because they were angry with the principal.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^606</a><!-- page 132 -->
In 1958, the Benedictine Sisters announced that their order would no longer be providing the Christie, British Columbia, school with staff from its monastery in Mount Angel, Oregon.<!-- page 132 -->
According to the prioress of the Benedictine monastery, Mother Mary Gemma, meeting residential school needs had left the members of the order physically and mentally exhausted.<!-- page 132 -->
“One of my youngest teachers had to have shock treatments this year and two others may have to.”<!-- page 132 -->
In the previous two and a half years, the order had lost fourteen teachers.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^607</a><!-- page 132 -->
These examples are confirmed by the overall statistics.<!-- page 132 -->
The average annual turnover rate for all Indian Affairs schools from 1956–57 to 1963–64 was 25%.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^608</a><!-- page 132 --></p>
<p>The schools were heavily dependent on female labour.<!-- page 132 -->
The Roman Catholics relied on female religious orders to staff and operate the residential schools.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^609</a><!-- page 132 -->
The Protestants were equally reliant upon the underpaid work of female staff.<!-- page 132 -->
Austin McKitrick, the principal of the Presbyterian school at Shoal Lake in northwestern Ontario, acknowledged this when he wrote in 1901, “I think if we men were to put ourselves in the places of some overworked, tired-out women, we would perhaps not stand it so patiently as they often do.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^610</a><!-- page 132 -->
One missionary wrote that, knowing what he did about what was expected of female missionaries, he would discourage any daughter of his from working for the Methodist Women’s Missionary Society.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^611</a><!-- page 132 --></p>
<p>Although women usually worked in subordinate roles, the 1906 Indian Affairs annual report listed eleven female principals.<!-- page 132 -->
All worked at boarding schools, as opposed to industrial schools.<!-- page 132 -->
Seven of them were Roman Catholic, two were Anglican, one was Methodist, and one was Presbyterian.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^612</a><!-- page 132 -->
One of these principals was Kate Gillespie.<!-- page 132 -->
After teaching at day schools on reserves near Kamsack and Prince Albert, she was appointed principal of the File Hills school in 1901, a position she held until her marriage in 1908.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^613</a><!-- page 132 --></p>
<p>The schools employed many more people than principals and teachers.<!-- page 132 -->
Most schools were mini-communities.<!-- page 132 -->
There were cooks, seamstresses, housekeepers, matrons, disciplinarians, farmers, carpenters, blacksmiths, engineers (to operate the heating and electrical generators), shoemakers, and even bandmasters.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^614</a><!-- page 132 -->
Smaller schools such as the United Church Crosby Girls’ Home in Port Simpson, British Columbia, made do with a staff of only three people in 1935.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^615</a><!-- page 132 -->
The Roman Catholic school at Kamloops, British Columbia, had at least nineteen staff in that same year.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^616</a><!-- page 132 -->
The Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, residence had over fifty employees during the 1966–67 school year.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^617</a><!-- page 132 --></p>
<p>Workloads were heavy, and time off was rare.<!-- page 132 -->
The seven-day week was the norm for many employees.<!-- page 132 -->
An 1896 report on the Mount Elgin school noted, “No holidays are given or allowed to the staff; all days or parts of days lost time are deducted from their wages.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^618</a><!-- page 132 -->
The policy at the Anglican schools into the 1920s was to allow “one full day off duty each month.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^619</a><!-- page 132 -->
Indian agent F. J. C. Ball predicted that a sixty-three-year-old employee of the Lytton school was headed for a nervous breakdown in 1922.<!-- page 132 --><!-- page 133 -->
According to Ball, the man was “acting as teacher, minister, janitor and general handy man around the School.<!-- page 133 -->
He also has charge of the boys [sic] dormitory at night.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^620</a><!-- page 133 --></p>
<p>Staff meals were generally superior to those provided to the students.<!-- page 133 -->
Staff members, particularly in the early years of the system, had greater immunity than their students to many of the diseases that plagued residential schools.<!-- page 133 -->
Despite this, the living conditions that prevailed in many schools took a toll on staff.<!-- page 133 -->
In 1896, E. B. Glass, the principal of the Whitefish Lake school in what is now Alberta, said the deterioration in the health of one staff member was the result of having to work in an inadequately heated and poorly insulated schoolhouse in which the “cold wind whistled up through the floor.”<!-- page 133 -->
Glass said that “the Department which charges itself with building, repairing and furnishing school houses, should also charge itself with neglect and the suffering endured by the teacher from that neglect.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^621</a><!-- page 133 --></p>
<p>Disease and illness also claimed the children of married staff members.<!-- page 133 -->
Emma Crosby, who helped found the Crosby Girls’ Home in Port Simpson in the late 1870s, buried four of her children at Port Simpson.<!-- page 133 -->
Two of them had succumbed to diphtheria.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^622</a><!-- page 133 -->
Elizabeth Matheson, the wife of the Onion Lake principal, lost a daughter to whooping cough and a son to meningeal croup in the early years of the twentieth century.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^623</a><!-- page 133 -->
During her fourth pregnancy, Elizabeth Matheson was so depressed that she considered suicide.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^624</a><!-- page 133 --></p>
<p>Missionary staff, particularly in the early years of the system, were extremely hostile to Aboriginal culture.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^625</a><!-- page 133 -->
They commonly described Aboriginal people as “lazy.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^626</a><!-- page 133 -->
The longtime principal of the Shubenacadie school in Nova Scotia, J. P. Mackey, was expressing these views in the 1930s.<!-- page 133 -->
In one letter, he described Aboriginal people as natural liars.<!-- page 133 -->
“For myself, I never hope to catch up with the Indian and his lies, and in fact I am not going to try.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^627</a><!-- page 133 -->
Others, however, spoke out on behalf of Aboriginal people.<!-- page 133 -->
Hugh McKay, the superintendent of Presbyterian missionary work among Aboriginal people, criticized the federal government for failing to implement its Treaty promises and for failing to alleviate the hunger crisis on the Prairies.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^628</a><!-- page 133 -->
Similarly, William Duncan, the Anglican missionary at Metlakatla, British Columbia, advised the Tsimshian on how to advance arguments in favour of Aboriginal title.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^629</a><!-- page 133 --></p>
<p>Sometimes, staff protested the way students were treated.<!-- page 133 -->
When two staff members of the Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, school resigned in 1952, they complained of the harsh disciplinary regime at the school.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^630</a><!-- page 133 -->
In 1957, Helen Clafton, an ex-dormitory supervisor, wrote of how, at the Lytton, British Columbia, school, “the ‘strap’ is altogether too much in evidence.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^631</a><!-- page 133 --></p>
<p>Aboriginal people also worked for the schools.<!-- page 133 -->
The Mohawk Institute hired former student Isaac Barefoot to work as a teacher in 1869.<!-- page 133 -->
Barefoot went on to serve as acting principal and was later ordained as an Anglican minister.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^632</a><!-- page 133 -->
Another former student, Susan Hardie, obtained her teaching certificate in 1886.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^633</a><!-- page 133 -->
She was the school governess as early as 1894, and was paid $200 a year.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^634</a><!-- page 133 -->
She retired at the beginning of the 1936–37 school year.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^635</a> A young Oneida woman, Miss Cornelius, taught at the Regina school in the early twentieth century.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^636</a> She left the following year, lured away to a better paying school in the United States.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^637</a><!-- page 133 --><!-- page 134 -->
In the early 1930s, the Brandon school hired former student Lulu Ironstar as a teacher.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^638</a><!-- page 134 -->
But these were exceptions, not the rule.<!-- page 134 -->
As late as 1960, there were only twenty-three First Nations teachers working in residential schools across the country.<!-- page 134 -->
Nineteen taught academic subjects and the other four taught home economics and industrial arts.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^639</a><!-- page 134 -->
Stan McKay, who was educated at the Birtle and Brandon residential schools, taught in the Norway House, Manitoba, school in the 1960s.<!-- page 134 -->
Although there was much that he enjoyed about the work, he left after two years.<!-- page 134 -->
In his opinion, the education he was being forced to provide was not relevant to the lives of the children.<!-- page 134 -->
There was, for example, a heavy emphasis on English, and no recognition of the role of Cree in the communities from which the children came.<!-- page 134 -->
“They were doomed to fail under the system that existed.<!-- page 134 -->
The majority of them would certainly and did.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^640</a><!-- page 134 --></p>
<p><img alt="Miss Cornelius, an Oneida woman, taught at the Regina, Saskatchewan, school in the early twentieth century. Saskatchewan Archives Board, R-B992." src="image-autofix/page-134.jpg" /><!-- page 134 --></p>
<p>Verna Kirkness, who was raised on the Fisher River First Nation in Manitoba, taught at both the Birtle and Norway House schools.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^641</a><!-- page 134 -->
She did not like the atmosphere at the Birtle school, where, she felt, administrators discouraged students from spending additional time with her.<!-- page 134 -->
In her memoir, she wrote that she “wondered if they were afraid the children would tell me things about their lives away from the classroom.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^642</a><!-- page 134 --></p>
<p>It was in the 1960s that a number of Aboriginal people were promoted to the position of school principal.<!-- page 134 -->
Ahab Spence, a former residential school student, was appointed principal of the Sioux Lookout school in 1963.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^643</a><!-- page 134 -->
Under Spence’s administration, the school had a staff of twenty-three, half of whom were Aboriginal.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^644</a><!-- page 134 -->
Colin Wasacase became the principal of the Presbyterian school in Kenora in 1966.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^645</a><!-- page 134 -->
In keeping with past practice, his wife was made school matron.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^646</a><!-- page 134 -->
This trend continued into the 1970s, when Aboriginal people were appointed to administrative positions at numerous residential schools, including those in Mission and Kamloops, British Columbia; Blue Quills, Alberta; Prince Albert, Duck Lake, and Qu’Appelle, Saskatchewan; and Fort George, Québec.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^647</a><!-- page 134 -->
Although the total number of schools declined rapidly from 1969 onwards, they became a significant source of Aboriginal employment, particularly in Saskatchewan, where six schools were operated by First Nations educational authorities.<!-- page 134 --><!-- page 135 -->
Of the 360 people working in the Saskatchewan schools in 1994, 220 were of Aboriginal ancestry—almost two-thirds of the total.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^648</a><!-- page 135 --></p>
<p>Most of the Aboriginal people who were hired by the schools worked as cooks, cleaners, and handymen.<!-- page 135 -->
In 1954, Mrs. Clair, a Cree woman who had attended the school at Lac La Ronge, Saskatchewan, was working at the Carcross school in the Yukon.<!-- page 135 -->
She was described by a superintendent as a “very fine person, willing worker and everyone likes her.<!-- page 135 -->
Can certainly get the most out of the children.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^649</a><!-- page 135 -->
At the Wabasca, Alberta, school, Alphonse Alook was seen as being “a tower of strength to the Principal especially of late.<!-- page 135 -->
Can do fair carpentering and is loyal to the school.<!-- page 135 -->
Principal recommends an increase in his salary.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^650</a><!-- page 135 -->
Four young Aboriginal women, three of whom were sisters, had been hired to work at the Fort George, Québec, school in 1953.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^651</a><!-- page 135 -->
A 1956 report on three of them said, “The Herodier girls are all doing a fine job.”<!-- page 135 -->
They were not, however, being housed in the same way as non-Aboriginal staff.<!-- page 135 -->
The report observed that it was fortunate that “the native girls do not mind doubling up in cramped quarters otherwise staff accommodation would be insufficient.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^652</a><!-- page 135 --></p>
<p>A number of former Aboriginal staff members felt they helped make an important difference in the lives of the students.<!-- page 135 -->
Jeanne Rioux went to the Edmonton school and later worked as a supervisor at the Hobbema school in Alberta.<!-- page 135 -->
There, she challenged staff about the way they disciplined children.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^653</a><!-- page 135 -->
Mary Chapman was a former residential school student who later worked in the kitchen of the Kuper Island school.<!-- page 135 -->
At her prompting, the school began serving students and staff the same meals.<!-- page 135 -->
It was her rule that “if we run out of roast, the kids run out of roast, I don’t give them bologna, I take the roast from the staff and I give it to them.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^654</a><!-- page 135 -->
Vitaline Elsie Jenner, who had unhappily attended the Fort Chipewyan, Alberta, residential school, worked as a girls’ supervisor at Breynat Hall, the Roman Catholic residence at Fort Smith, Northwest Territories.<!-- page 135 -->
To her surprise, she enjoyed most of the experience.<!-- page 135 -->
She recalled being asked by one staff person what sort of games she thought the children would like to play to make them feel at home.<!-- page 135 -->
“I said, ‘You know I bet you they all want to be hugged, like I was in that residential school.<!-- page 135 -->
’Cause you know what?<!-- page 135 -->
They’re away from their parents.’”655<!-- page 135 --></p>
<p>Former staff and the children of former staff members have expressed the view that much of the discussion of the history of residential schools has overlooked both the positive intent with which many staff members approached their work, and the positive accomplishments of the school system.<!-- page 135 -->
Although they certainly believed the system was underfunded, they also believed that they and their parents devoted much of their lives to educating and caring for Aboriginal children.<!-- page 135 --></p>
<p>Most of the staff members did not make a career in residential schools, spending only a year or two at a school before moving on.<!-- page 135 -->
Others stayed for many years in conditions that were often very different from what they grew up with, working for low pay, and living in cramped and confined quarters with, at times, less than congenial colleagues.<!-- page 135 -->
They spent their time teaching, cooking, cleaning, farming, and supervising children.<!-- page 135 -->
On their own, these can be seen as positive, not negative, activities.<!-- page 135 --><!-- page 136 -->
For the most part, the school staff members were not responsible for the policies that separated children from their parents and lodged them in inadequate and underfunded facilities.<!-- page 136 -->
In fact, many staff members spent much of their time and energy attempting to humanize a harsh and often destructive system.<!-- page 136 -->
Along with the children’s own resilience, such staff members share credit for any positive results of the schools.<!-- page 136 --></p>

<p>During the years in which the federal government was slowly closing the residential school system, Aboriginal people across the country were establishing effective regional and national organizations.<!-- page 136 -->
In the courts and the legislatures, they argued for the recognition of Aboriginal rights, particularly the right to self-government.<!-- page 136 -->
They forced the government to withdraw its 1969 White Paper that aimed at terminating Aboriginal rights, they placed the settling of land claims on the national agenda, ensured that Aboriginal rights were entrenched in the Constitution, and saw the creation of a new jurisdiction within Canada—the territory of Nunavut—with an Inuit majority population.<!-- page 136 -->
These developments were part of a global movement asserting the rights of Indigenous peoples.<!-- page 136 -->
Canadian Aboriginal leaders played a key role in this movement.<!-- page 136 -->
For example, they were central in the creation of the World Council of Indigenous Peoples in 1975.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^656</a><!-- page 136 -->
The work of the council laid the groundwork for the 2007 <em>United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples</em>.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^657</a><!-- page 136 --></p>
<p>From the 1960s onwards, many people within the churches began to re-evaluate both the broader history of the relations between the churches and Aboriginal peoples, and the specific history of the residential schools.<!-- page 136 -->
Many church organizations provided support to Aboriginal campaigns on such issues as land and Treaty rights.<!-- page 136 -->
In the 1980s, the churches began to issue apologies to Aboriginal people.<!-- page 136 -->
One of the first of these, issued in 1986 by the United Church of Canada, focused on the destructive impact that church missionary work had on Aboriginal culture.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^658</a><!-- page 136 -->
The Oblate order offered an apology in 1991 that referred to the residential schools.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^659</a><!-- page 136 -->
Apologies relating specifically to their roles in operating residential schools were issued by the Anglicans in 1993, the Presbyterians in 1994, and the United Church in 1998.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^660</a><!-- page 136 --></p>
<p>Aboriginal people also began both individually and collectively to push for the prosecution of individuals who had abused students at residential schools and for compensation for former students.<!-- page 136 -->
In 1987, Nora Bernard, a former student of the Shubenacadie residential school, began interviewing fellow Survivors in the kitchen of her home in Truro, Nova Scotia.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^661</a><!-- page 136 -->
In 1995, she formed the Shubenacadie Indian Residential School Survivors Association and started registering Survivors.<!-- page 136 -->
The work of former students from the schools in places as distant as Fort Albany, Ontario; Chesterfield Inlet, then in the Northwest Territories; and Williams Lake, British Columbia, led to several police investigations, and a limited number of prosecutions and convictions.<!-- page 136 --><!-- page 137 -->
They also led to the creation of local and national organizations of former residential school students.<!-- page 137 -->
Phil Fontaine, then Grand Chief of the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs, placed the issue on the national agenda in October 1990 when he spoke publicly about the abuse that he and his fellow students had experienced at the Fort Alexander school.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^662</a><!-- page 137 --></p>
<p>Former students also filed lawsuits against the federal government and the churches over the treatment that they received in the schools.<!-- page 137 -->
Although they were successful in a number of these cases, courts were not willing to provide compensation for some issues of importance to Aboriginal peoples, such as the loss of language and culture.<!-- page 137 -->
By October 2001, more than 8,500 residential school Survivors had filed lawsuits against the federal government, the churches, related organizations, and, where possible, the individual who committed the abuse.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^663</a><!-- page 137 -->
By 2005, it was estimated that the volume surpassed 18,000 lawsuits.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^664</a><!-- page 137 -->
Former students also commenced class-action lawsuits for compensation.<!-- page 137 -->
Although lower courts rejected their right to pursue such claims, in 2004, the Ontario Court of Appeal ruled that one of these cases (known as the “Cloud case”) should be allowed to proceed.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^665</a><!-- page 137 -->
Within months, the federal government agreed to enter into a process intended to negotiate a settlement to the growing number of class-action suits.<!-- page 137 -->
The Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement (IRSSA) was reached in 2006 and approved by the courts in the following year.<!-- page 137 -->
The IRSSA has five main components: 1) a Common Experience Payment; 2) an Independent Assessment Process; 3) support for the Aboriginal Health Foundation; 4) support for residential school commemoration; and 5) the establishment of a Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada.<!-- page 137 -->
Through the Common Experience Payment, former students would receive a payment of $10,000 for the first year that they attended a residential school, and an additional $3,000 for each additional year or partial year of attendance.<!-- page 137 -->
The Independent Assessment Process adjudicated and compensated the claims of those students who were physically or sexually abused at the schools.<!-- page 137 -->
Funding was also provided to the Aboriginal Healing Foundation to support initiatives addressing the residential school legacy.<!-- page 137 -->
The Settlement Agreement committed the federal government to funding initiatives to commemorate the residential school experience.<!-- page 137 -->
The Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada was mandated to tell Canadians about the history of residential schools and the impact those schools had on Aboriginal peoples, and to guide a process of reconciliation.<!-- page 137 --></p>
<p>The court approval of the IRSSA in 2007 was followed in June 2008 with Prime Minister Stephen Harper’s apology on behalf of Canada.<!-- page 137 -->
In his statement, the prime minister recognized that the primary purpose of the schools had been to remove children from their homes and families in order to assimilate them better into the dominant culture.<!-- page 137 -->
Harper said, “These objectives were based on the assumption Aboriginal cultures and spiritual beliefs were inferior and unequal.<!-- page 137 -->
Indeed, some sought, as it was infamously said, ‘to kill the Indian in the child.’ Today, we recognize that this policy of assimilation was wrong, has caused great harm, and has no place in our country.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^666</a><!-- page 137 --><!-- page 138 --></p>
<p>The prime minister was joined by the leaders of the other parties represented in the Canadian House of Commons.<!-- page 138 -->
The Liberal leader of the opposition, the Honourable Stéphane Dion, recognized that the government’s policy had “destroyed the fabric of family in First Nations, Métis and Inuit communities.<!-- page 138 -->
Parents and children were made to feel worthless.<!-- page 138 -->
Parents and grandparents were given no choice.<!-- page 138 -->
Their children were stolen from them.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^667</a><!-- page 138 -->
The Bloc Québecois leader, the Honourable Gilles Duceppe, asked Canadians to “picture a small village, a small community.<!-- page 138 -->
Now picture all of its children, gone.<!-- page 138 -->
No more children between seven and sixteen playing in the lanes or the woods, filling the hearts of their elders with their laughter and joy.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^668</a><!-- page 138 -->
The New Democratic Party leader, the Honourable Jack Layton, called on Canadians to help<!-- page 138 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>reverse the horrific and shameful statistics afflicting Aboriginal populations, now: the high rates of poverty, suicide, the poor or having no education, overcrowding, crumbling housing, and unsafe drinking water.<!-- page 138 -->
Let us make sure that all survivors of the residential schools receive the recognition and compensation that is due to them.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^669</a><!-- page 138 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In his response, Phil Fontaine, then National Chief of the Assembly of First Nations, said the apology marked a new dawn in the relationship between Aboriginal people and the rest of Canada.<!-- page 138 -->
He also called attention to the “brave survivors,” who, by “the telling of their painful stories, have stripped white supremacy of its authority and legitimacy.<!-- page 138 -->
The irresistibility of speaking truth to power is real.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^670</a><!-- page 138 -->
National Chief of the Congress of Aboriginal Peoples Patrick Brazeau spoke of how the resiliency, courage, and strength of residential school Survivors had inspired all Aboriginal people.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^671</a><!-- page 138 -->
Mary Simon, President of the Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, said, in tackling the hard work that remained to be done, “Let us now join forces with the common goal of working together to ensure that this apology opens the door to a new chapter in our lives as aboriginal peoples and in our place in Canada.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^672</a><!-- page 138 -->
Clem Chartier, President of the Métis National Council, noted that he had attended a residential school, and pointed out that many issues regarding the relationship between Métis people and residential schools still were not resolved.<!-- page 138 -->
He said, “I also feel deeply conflicted, because there is still misunderstanding about the situation of the Métis Nation, our history and our contemporary situation.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^673</a><!-- page 138 -->
Beverley Jacobs, President of the Native Women’s Association of Canada, spoke of how Aboriginal communities were recovering their traditions.<!-- page 138 -->
“Now we have our language still, we have our ceremonies, we have our elders, and we have to revitalize those ceremonies and the respect for our people not only within Canadian society but even within our own peoples.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^674</a><!-- page 138 --></p>
<p>The Settlement Agreement and the formal apology by Prime Minister Stephen Harper represent the culmination of years of political struggle, changes in societal attitudes, court decisions, and negotiation.<!-- page 138 -->
Through it all, the Survivors kept the issue alive.<!-- page 138 --></p>

<p>These events do not bring the residential school story to an end.<!-- page 139 -->
The legacy of the schools remains.<!-- page 139 -->
One can see the impact of a system that disrupted families in the high number of Aboriginal children who have been removed from their families by child-welfare agencies.<!-- page 139 -->
An educational system that degraded Aboriginal culture and subjected students to humiliating discipline must bear a portion of responsibility for the current gap between the educational success of Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Canadians.<!-- page 139 -->
The health of generations of Aboriginal children was undermined by inadequate diets, poor sanitation, overcrowded conditions, and a failure to address the tuberculosis crisis that was ravaging the country’s Aboriginal community.<!-- page 139 -->
There should be little wonder that Aboriginal health status remains far below that of the general population.<!-- page 139 -->
The over-incarceration and over-victimization of Aboriginal people also have links to a system that subjected Aboriginal children to punitive discipline and exposed them to physical and sexual abuse.<!-- page 139 --></p>
<p>The history of residential schools presented in this report commenced by placing the schools in the broader history of the global European colonization of Indigenous peoples and their lands.<!-- page 140 -->
Residential schooling was only a part of the colonization of Aboriginal people.<!-- page 140 -->
The policy of colonization suppressed Aboriginal culture and languages, disrupted Aboriginal government, destroyed Aboriginal economies, and confined Aboriginal people to marginal and often unproductive land.<!-- page 140 -->
When that policy resulted in hunger, disease, and poverty, the federal government failed to meet its obligations to Aboriginal people.<!-- page 140 -->
That policy was dedicated to eliminating Aboriginal peoples as distinct political and cultural entities and must be described for what it was: a policy of cultural genocide.<!-- page 140 --></p>
<p>Despite being subjected to aggressive assimilation policies for nearly 200 years, Aboriginal people have maintained their identity and their communities.<!-- page 140 -->
They continue to assert their rights to self-governance.<!-- page 140 -->
In this, they are not alone.<!-- page 140 -->
Like the Settlement Agreement in Canada, the <em>United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples</em> is a milestone in a global campaign to recognize and respect the rights of Indigenous peoples.<!-- page 140 -->
It is time to abandon the colonial policies of the past, to address the legacy of the schools, and to engage in a process of reconciliation with the Aboriginal people of Canada.<!-- page 140 --></p>

<blockquote>
<p>I want Canadians to understand that [the legacy of the residential schools] does not just affect the lives of the person who actually attended the school, but family members, such as spouses and children, are also very deeply affected about this sad legacy in history.<!-- page 189 --></p>
<p>—  Johanne Coutu-Autut, spouse of former Turquetil Hall resident1<!-- page 189 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Residential schools are a tragic part of Canada’s history.<!-- page 189 -->
But they cannot simply be consigned to history.<!-- page 189 -->
The legacy from the schools and the political and legal policies and mechanisms surrounding their history continue to this day.<!-- page 189 -->
This is reflected in the significant educational, income, health, and social disparities between Aboriginal people and other Canadians.<!-- page 189 -->
It is reflected in the intense racism some people harbour against Aboriginal people and in the systemic and other forms of discrimination Aboriginal people regularly experience in this country.<!-- page 189 -->
It is reflected too in the critically endangered status of most Aboriginal languages.<!-- page 189 --></p>
<p>Current conditions such as the disproportionate apprehension of Aboriginal children by child-welfare agencies and the disproportionate imprisonment and victimization of Aboriginal people can be explained in part as a result or legacy of the way that Aboriginal children were treated in residential schools and were denied an environment of positive parenting, worthy community leaders, and a positive sense of identity and self-worth.<!-- page 189 -->
The schools could be brutal places, as Joseph Martin Larocque, a former student at the Beauval residential school in Saskatchewan, told the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada.<!-- page 189 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Residential school] was a very harsh environment.<!-- page 189 -->
They, they treated us like criminals…<!-- page 189 -->
You, you had to, it’s like a prison.<!-- page 189 -->
But we were small kids, and we didn’t understand.<!-- page 189 -->
We didn’t understand harsh discipline.<!-- page 189 -->
We, we understood love from our, our parents.<!-- page 189 -->
But the harsh discipline was hard to take, and that happened to everybody, not only me.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^2</a><!-- page 189 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The impacts of the legacy of residential schools have not ended with those who attended the schools.<!-- page 189 -->
They affected the Survivors’ partners, their children, their grandchildren, their extended families, and their communities.<!-- page 189 --><!-- page 190 -->
Children who were abused in the schools sometimes went on to abuse others.<!-- page 190 -->
Many students who spoke to the Commission said they developed addictions as a means of coping.<!-- page 190 -->
Students who were treated and punished like prisoners in the schools often graduated to real prisons.<!-- page 190 -->
For many, the path from residential school to prison was a short one.<!-- page 190 -->
Mervin Mirasty was a student at the Beauval residential school.<!-- page 190 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I ran away from school.<!-- page 190 -->
I’d go out, I’d walk around town, and steal whatever I could steal…<!-- page 190 -->
I started stealing cars.<!-- page 190 -->
I got caught at fifteen.<!-- page 190 -->
I ended up in jail.<!-- page 190 -->
From that point of fifteen years old ’til …<!-- page 190 -->
to the year 2000, I got sentenced to twenty-five years all together, twenty-five years all together.<!-- page 190 -->
And I don’t know what I was fighting, what I was trying to do.<!-- page 190 -->
I didn’t care who I stole from.<!-- page 190 -->
I drank.<!-- page 190 -->
I started drinking when I was about seventeen, eighteen.<!-- page 190 -->
I drank, I stole, I hardly worked.<!-- page 190 -->
I used the system, the welfare system, and plus I stole, and I drank.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^3</a><!-- page 190 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Children exposed to strict and regimented discipline in the schools sometimes found it difficult to become loving parents.<!-- page 190 -->
Genine Paul-Dimitracopoulos’s mother was placed in the Shubenacadie residential school in Nova Scotia at a very early age.<!-- page 190 -->
PaulDimitracopoulos told the Commission that knowing this, and what the school was like, helped her understand “how we grew up because my mom never really showed us love when we were kids coming up.<!-- page 190 -->
She, when I was hurt or cried, she was never there to console you or to hug you.<!-- page 190 -->
If I hurt myself she would never give me a hug and tell me it would be okay.<!-- page 190 -->
I didn’t understand why.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^4</a><!-- page 190 -->
Alma Scott of Winnipeg told the Commission that as “a direct result of those residential schools because I was a dysfunctional mother…<!-- page 190 -->
I spent over twenty years of my life stuck in a bottle in an addiction where I didn’t want to feel any emotions so I numbed out with drugs and with alcohol….<!-- page 190 -->
That’s how I raised my children, that’s what my children saw, and that’s what I saw.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^5</a><!-- page 190 --></p>
<p>The Commission is convinced that genuine reconciliation will not be possible until the complex legacy of the schools is understood, acknowledged, and addressed.<!-- page 190 -->
Parliament and the Supreme Court have recognized that the legacy of residential schools should be considered when sentencing Aboriginal offenders.<!-- page 190 -->
Although these have been important measures, they have not been sufficient to address the grossly disproportionate imprisonment of Aboriginal people, which continues to grow, in part because of a lack of adequate funding and support for culturally appropriate alternatives to imprisonment.<!-- page 190 --></p>
<p>More First Nations child-welfare agencies have been established, but the disproportionate apprehension of Aboriginal children also continues to grow.<!-- page 190 -->
In part, this has happened because of a lack of adequate funding for culturally appropriate supports that would allow children to remain safely with their families, or to allow children to be placed in foster or adoptive environments that are culturally appropriate and capable of giving children a sense of identity, self-respect, and self-worth.<!-- page 190 --></p>
<p>Many of the individual and collective harms have not yet been redressed, even after the negotiated out-of-court settlement of the residential school litigation in 2006, and Canada’s apology in 2008.<!-- page 190 --><!-- page 191 -->
In fact, some of the damages done by residential schools to Aboriginal families, languages, education, and health may be perpetuated and even worsened as a result of current governmental policies.<!-- page 191 -->
New policies can easily be based on a lack of understanding of Aboriginal people, similar to that which motivated the schools.<!-- page 191 -->
For example, current child-welfare and health policies that fail to take into account the importance of community in raising children can result in inappropriate decision making.<!-- page 191 -->
We must learn from the failure of the schools in order to ensure that the mistakes of the past are not repeated in the future.<!-- page 191 --></p>
<p>Despite the challenges and failings in responding to the legacy of residential schools, and a concern that the federal government may have lost a sense of urgency on these issues since the 2006 Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement and Canada’s apology in 2008, the Commission is nonetheless cautiously optimistic that promising pathways to constructive reforms do exist.<!-- page 191 -->
These could include new strategies based on respect for Aboriginal self-determination and for Canada’s obligations under Treaties, and Canada’s endorsement of the new <em>United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples</em>.<!-- page 191 --></p>
<p>In its February 2012 <em>Interim Report</em>, the Commission observed that the <em>United Nations Declaration</em> provides a valuable framework for working towards ongoing reconciliation between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Canadians.<!-- page 191 -->
We continue to encourage all governments, and all the legal parties to the Settlement Agreement, to use it as such a framework.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^6</a><!-- page 191 --></p>
<p>The Government of Canada initially refused to adopt the Declaration.<!-- page 191 -->
When it finally did endorse the Declaration, it did not fully embrace its principles, saying that “it is a non-legally binding document that does not reflect customary international law nor change Canadian laws.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^7</a><!-- page 191 -->
The Commission is convinced that a refusal to respect the rights and remedies in the Declaration will serve to further aggravate the legacy of residential schools, and will constitute a barrier to progress towards reconciliation.<!-- page 191 --></p>
<section class="section2" id="child-welfare"><h2><a class="toclink" href="#child-welfare">Child welfare<!-- page 191 --></a></h2>
<p>Residential schools, as acknowledged by the prime minister’s own admission in his 2008 official apology from Canada, were an attack on Aboriginal children and families.<!-- page 191 -->
They were based on racist attitudes that considered Aboriginal families as being frequently unfit to care for their children.<!-- page 191 -->
By removing children from their communities and by subjecting them to strict discipline, religious indoctrination, and a regimented life more akin to life in a prison than a family, residential schools often harmed the subsequent ability of the students to be caring parents.<!-- page 191 -->
In many ways, the schools were more a child-welfare system than an educational one.<!-- page 191 -->
A survey in 1953 suggested that of 10,112 students then in residential schools, 4,313 were either orphans or from what were described as “broken homes.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^8</a><!-- page 191 -->
From the 1940s onwards, residential schools increasingly served as orphanages and child-welfare facilities.<!-- page 191 --><!-- page 192 -->
By 1960, the federal government estimated that 50% of the children in residential schools were there for child-welfare reasons.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^9</a><!-- page 192 --></p>
<p>The residential school experience was followed by the “Sixties Scoop”—the wide-scale national apprehension of Aboriginal children by child-welfare agencies.<!-- page 192 -->
Child-welfare authorities removed thousands of Aboriginal children from their families and communities and placed them in non-Aboriginal homes without taking steps to preserve their culture and identity.<!-- page 192 -->
Children were placed in homes across Canada, in the United States, and even overseas.<!-- page 192 -->
This practice actually extended well beyond the 1960s, until at least the mid- to late 1980s.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^10</a><!-- page 192 --></p>
<p>Today, the effects of the residential school experience and the Sixties Scoop have adversely affected parenting skills and the success of many Aboriginal families.<!-- page 192 -->
These factors, combined with prejudicial attitudes toward Aboriginal parenting skills and a tendency to see Aboriginal poverty as a symptom of neglect, rather than as a consequence of failed government policies, have resulted in grossly disproportionate rates of child apprehension among Aboriginal people.<!-- page 192 -->
A 2011 Statistics Canada study found that 14,225 or 3.6% of all First Nations children aged fourteen and under were in foster care, compared with 15,345 or 0.3% of non-Aboriginal children.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^11</a><!-- page 192 -->
As Old Crow Chief Norma Kassi said at the Northern National Event in Inuvik, “The doors are closed at the residential schools but the foster homes are still existing and our children are still being taken away.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^12</a><!-- page 192 -->
The Commission agrees: Canada’s child-welfare system has simply continued the assimilation that the residential school system started.<!-- page 192 --></p>
<p>Canada’s child-welfare crisis has not gone unnoticed in the international community.<!-- page 192 -->
In 2012, the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child expressed to Canada its concern about the frequent removal of children in Canada from families as a “first resort” in cases of neglect, financial hardship, or disability.<!-- page 192 -->
In its report, the committee singled out the frequency with which Aboriginal children are placed outside their communities.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^13</a><!-- page 192 -->
Noting that Canada had failed to act on its own auditor general’s findings of inequitable child-welfare funding, the committee concluded that “urgent measures” were needed to address the discriminatory overrepresentation of Aboriginal children in out-of-home care.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^14</a><!-- page 192 --></p>
<section class="section3" id="disturbing-data"><h3><a class="toclink" href="#disturbing-data">Disturbing data<!-- page 192 --></a></h3>
<p>The First Nations Component of the Canadian Incidence Study of Reported Child Abuse and Neglect, designed by the Public Health Agency of Canada and its provincial, academic, and agency partners, confirmed that Aboriginal children in the geographic areas studied are also significantly overrepresented as subjects of child maltreatment investigations.<!-- page 192 -->
For every 1,000 First Nations children, there were 140.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^6</a><!-- page 192 -->
child maltreatment-related investigations, as compared with 33.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^5</a><!-- page 192 -->
investigations for non-Aboriginal children.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^15</a><!-- page 192 -->
The rate of investigations involving First Nations children was 4.2 times the rate of non-Aboriginal investigations.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^16</a><!-- page 192 --><!-- page 193 -->
The study also found that in the population under review, those allegations were more likely to be substantiated in the cases of First Nations children.<!-- page 193 -->
This was true for all categories of maltreatment, but the difference was most extreme for investigations of neglect.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^17</a><!-- page 193 -->
Investigations of First Nations families for neglect were substantiated at a rate eight times greater than for the non-Aboriginal population.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^18</a><!-- page 193 --></p>
<p>An analysis of the Canadian Incidence Study confirmed that poverty and social stressors are major factors in child-welfare investigations involving Aboriginal families.<!-- page 193 -->
Aboriginal parents were more likely to experience a host of serious risk factors, including domestic violence, alcohol abuse, lack of social supports, drug or solvent abuse, and a history of living in foster care or group homes.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^19</a><!-- page 193 -->
The direct connection between Aboriginal poverty and high child-welfare apprehensions has been known for half a century.<!-- page 193 -->
Yet, Aboriginal children are still taken away from their parents because their parents are poor.<!-- page 193 --></p>
<p>Researchers suggest that clear standards are needed to guide apprehensions, and that the provision of family supports and prevention services might be a better response to concerns than removal of the child.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^20</a><!-- page 193 -->
There must be a commitment to reducing the number of Aboriginal children in care and developing supports to keep families together.<!-- page 193 -->
Child-welfare workers must bring to their work an understanding of Aboriginal culture as well as an understanding of the lasting harms caused by residential schools.<!-- page 193 --></p>

<p>The child-welfare system apprehends too many Aboriginal children while, at the same time, failing to protect them.<!-- page 194 -->
The Commission heard many stories of mistreatment in foster homes.<!-- page 194 -->
One woman told us that her foster parents physically and sexually abused her.<!-- page 194 -->
Her Aboriginal identity was constantly disparaged.<!-- page 194 -->
She said, “[My foster parents were] adamant about Aboriginal culture being less than human, living as dirty bush people, eating rats.<!-- page 194 -->
It made me not want to be one of those people.<!-- page 194 -->
And for years, I didn’t know how to be proud of who I was because I didn’t know who I was.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^21</a><!-- page 194 --></p>
<p>Linda Clarke was placed in a foster home with three other children.<!-- page 194 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In that foster home there was a pedophile, and I don’t [know] what was happening to anybody else, but I became his target.<!-- page 194 -->
The mother used to always send me to do errands with him.<!-- page 194 -->
And so every time, he would make me do things to him and then he would give me candy.<!-- page 194 -->
Also, in that home there was no hugging of us foster kids or anything like that.<!-- page 194 -->
And I carried a great guilt for many, many years, because sometimes I didn’t want to resist it, I just….<!-- page 194 -->
But I knew it was very bad.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^22</a><!-- page 194 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sometimes, child-welfare placements end in tragedy.<!-- page 194 -->
Where there are province-specific statistics available, the findings suggest that in some parts of the country, Aboriginal children who come into contact with child-welfare authorities are significantly more likely to die.<!-- page 194 --></p>
<p>Research in Alberta indicated that 78% of children who have died in foster care between 1999 and mid-2013 were Aboriginal.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^23</a><!-- page 194 -->
Since Aboriginal children, a minority of the overall population, represent 59% of children in care in Alberta, the rate of Aboriginal child deaths in care is even more disproportionate than the apprehension rate.<!-- page 194 -->
Of the seventy-four recorded deaths of Aboriginal children in care, thirteen were due to accidents, twelve children committed suicide, and ten children were the victims of homicide.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^24</a><!-- page 194 -->
Forty-five of these Aboriginal children died while in the care of a provincial child-welfare agency, and twenty-nine died in the care of an on-reserve First Nations child and family service agency.<!-- page 194 --><!-- page 195 --></p>
</section><section class="section3" id="delivery-of-child-welfare-services"><h3><a class="toclink" href="#delivery-of-child-welfare-services">Delivery of child-welfare services<!-- page 195 --></a></h3>
<p>There are over 300 child-welfare agencies in Canada operating under provincial and territorial jurisdiction.<!-- page 195 -->
In addition, Canada provides funding to over 100 agencies delivering child and family services to First Nations families under the framework of provincial legislation.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^25</a><!-- page 195 -->
In 2010–11, there were 9,241 First Nations children outside the parental home and in the care of these First Nations child and family service agencies, representing 5.5% of on-reserve children.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^26</a><!-- page 195 -->
A few larger Canadian cities (such as Toronto and Vancouver) also have Aboriginal child and family service agencies.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^27</a><!-- page 195 -->
In Manitoba, there is also an agency serving Métis families.<!-- page 195 -->
There are, however, no Aboriginally controlled agencies in the three northern territories; child-welfare services to Aboriginal families there are provided through the same government agencies that serve all children.<!-- page 195 -->
In two out of the three territories, Aboriginal people make up a majority of the members in their legislatures and cabinets.<!-- page 195 --></p>
<p>Although the federal government acknowledges its responsibility for child-welfare services to First Nations families, Métis communities are not well served.<!-- page 195 -->
The Commission believes that adequately funded, Métis-specific, child and family services must be made available to Métis children and families.<!-- page 195 -->
The Government of Canada should not let unresolved jurisdictional disputes stand in the way of the acceptance of such responsibilities.<!-- page 195 -->
Similarly, the Commission believes the Government of Canada should ensure the development of adequately resourced Inuit child-welfare services in the North and in urban centres such as Ottawa and Montreal that have a significant Inuit population.<!-- page 195 --></p>
</section><section class="section3" id="lack-of-adequate-funding"><h3><a class="toclink" href="#lack-of-adequate-funding">Lack of adequate funding<!-- page 195 --></a></h3>
<p>Proof of the effectiveness of First Nations child and family service agencies is still preliminary, but anecdotal evidence and case studies suggest that First Nation agencies are more effective than non-Aboriginal agencies in providing service to First Nation clients.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^28</a><!-- page 195 -->
But, it is troubling that the ability of First Nations child and family services agencies to develop culturally appropriate services has been constrained by limited funding.<!-- page 195 -->
Of twelve First Nations agencies surveyed in 2005, 83.4% reported that they did not receive adequate funds to ensure culturally appropriate services.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^29</a><!-- page 195 -->
It is clear that the way in which Canada has funded Aboriginal child welfare has hampered First Nations agencies in providing effective services.<!-- page 195 -->
This shortfall continues to inflict pain on Aboriginal families and communities, and contributes to the continuing overrepresentation of Aboriginal children in foster care.<!-- page 195 --><!-- page 196 --></p>
</section><section class="section3" id="jurisdictional-disputes"><h3><a class="toclink" href="#jurisdictional-disputes">Jurisdictional disputes<!-- page 196 --></a></h3>
<p>Jurisdictional responsibility for child welfare is intensely contested.<!-- page 196 -->
Historically, the federal government and provincial and territorial governments have tried to shift responsibility for Aboriginal child services from one level of government to another.<!-- page 196 -->
The federal position is that responsibility for child and family services lies solely within the jurisdiction of the provinces and territories.<!-- page 196 -->
Canada contends that the federal government is responsible for funding only on-reserve services.<!-- page 196 -->
In contrast, the provinces maintain that the federal government has constitutional responsibility for ‘Indians,’ and argue that Ottawa has off-loaded that responsibility to the provinces to provide services to an increasingly urban, non-reserve population.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^30</a><!-- page 196 --></p>
<p>The result is that there are often disputes over which level of government or department is responsible for paying costs.<!-- page 196 -->
The repercussions of these disputes can be serious, with Aboriginal children paying the highest price—in particular, children with complex developmental, mental health, and physical health issues.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^31</a><!-- page 196 --></p>
<p>In 2007, the House of Commons unanimously supported the adoption of “Jordan’s Principle,” named in honour of a Manitoba infant born with complex medical needs who spent all of his short life in hospital, caught up in a federal–provincial jurisdictional dispute over responsibility for funding his care.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^32</a><!-- page 196 -->
According to Jordan’s Principle, the government department that is first contacted for a service available only off-reserve must pay for it and later pursue reimbursement for the expenses.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^33</a><!-- page 196 -->
But Jordan’s Principle was not passed into law; rather, it is a statement of principle by the Canadian parliament.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^34</a><!-- page 196 -->

<p>Although there is now considerable Aboriginal control of child-welfare services, Aboriginal agencies still struggle for adequate funding.<!-- page 196 -->
There is a need for more funding and research into preventive services that can support Aboriginal families.<!-- page 196 -->
At the same time, many of the conditions that result in disproportionate Aboriginal involvement in the child-welfare system are related to more intractable legacies of residential schools, including poverty, addictions, and domestic and sexual violence.<!-- page 196 --><!-- page 197 -->
We believe that in order to redress the legacy of residential schools and to move towards more respectful and healthy relationships, the Government of Canada, in meaningful consultation with First Nations, Inuit, and Métis communities, must recognize and address the broader context of the child-welfare crisis.<!-- page 197 -->
This includes matters of child poverty, housing, water, sanitation, food security, family violence, addictions, and educational inequities.<!-- page 197 -->
Effective child-welfare reform will require both measureable targets and timelines for reducing the numbers and proportion of Aboriginal children in care, greater consistency in the system’s regulatory framework, and the acknowledgement of the central role of Aboriginal agencies.<!-- page 197 --></p>
<p>Canada has rejected First Nations’ demands to operate services in accordance with traditional laws and traditional justice systems.<!-- page 197 -->
By contrast, in the United States, tribal courts have played an important role in the child-welfare system since 1978.<!-- page 197 -->
These courts have exclusive jurisdiction over custody proceedings involving Native American children living on a reservation.<!-- page 197 -->
They may also play a role in Native American child-custody cases where the child lives outside a reservation.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^35</a><!-- page 197 -->
While not perfect, the American system has led to greater tribal authority over the placement of Indigenous children, as well as the expansion of family preservation programs.<!-- page 197 -->
Indigenous children are still removed from their homes in disproportionately high numbers, but the rate of overrepresentation has decreased.<!-- page 197 -->
The rate of placement with non-Indigenous caregivers has also decreased.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^36</a><!-- page 197 --></p>

Instead, they created dangerous and frightening institutions that provided little learning.<!-- page 198 --></p>
<p>In their mission to ‘civilize’ and Christianize, the school staff relied on corporal punishment to discipline their students.<!-- page 198 -->
That punishment often crossed the line into physical abuse.<!-- page 198 -->
Although it is employed much less frequently now, corporal punishment is still legally permissible in schools and elsewhere under Canadian law.<!-- page 198 -->
Section 43 of the <em>Criminal Code</em> says: “Every schoolteacher, parent or person standing in the place of a parent is justified in using force by way of correction toward a pupil or child, as the case may be, who is under his care, if the force does not exceed what is reasonable under the circumstances.”<!-- page 198 -->
The Commission believes that corporal punishment is a relic of a discredited past and has no place in Canadian schools or homes.<!-- page 198 --></p>

</ol>
<p>The objectives of the schools were to strip away Aboriginal children’s identities and assimilate them into Western Christian society.<!-- page 198 -->
Doris Young, who attended the Elkhorn residential school in Manitoba, described the experience as a systematic attack on her identity as a Cree person.<!-- page 198 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Those schools were a war on Aboriginal children, and they took away our identity.<!-- page 198 -->
First of all, they gave us numbers, we had no names, we were numbers, and they cut our hair.<!-- page 198 -->
They took away our clothes, and gave us clothes …<!-- page 198 -->
we all looked alike.<!-- page 198 -->
Our hair was all the same, cut us into bangs, and straight short, straight hair up to our ears…<!-- page 198 -->
They took away our moccasins, and gave us shoes.<!-- page 198 -->
I was just a baby.<!-- page 198 -->
I didn’t actually wear shoes, we wore moccasins.<!-- page 198 --><!-- page 199 -->
And so our identity was immediately taken away when we entered those schools.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^37</a><!-- page 199 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In addition to the emotional and psychological damage they inflicted, one of the most far-reaching and devastating legacies of residential schools has been their impact on the educational and economic success of Aboriginal people.<!-- page 199 -->
The lack of role models and mentors, insufficient funds for the schools, inadequate teachers, and unsuitable curricula generally taught in a foreign language—and sometimes by teachers who were also not proficient in the language of instruction—have all contributed to dismal success rates for Aboriginal education.<!-- page 199 -->
These conditions were compounded for many students by the challenges of trying to learn in environments rendered traumatic by homesickness, hunger, fear, abuse, and institutionalized helplessness.<!-- page 199 -->
The Commission has heard many examples of students who attended residential school for eight or more years, but left with nothing more than Grade Three achievement, and sometimes without even the ability to read.<!-- page 199 -->
According to Indian Affairs annual reports, in the 1950s, only half of each year’s enrolment got to Grade Six.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^38</a><!-- page 199 --></p>
<p>Poor educational achievement has led to the chronic unemployment or under-employment, poverty, poor housing, substance abuse, family violence, and ill health that many former students of the schools have suffered as adults.<!-- page 199 -->
Although educational success rates are slowly improving, Aboriginal Canadians still have dramatically lower educational and economic achievements than other Canadians.<!-- page 199 --></p>
<p>Education is a fundamental human and Aboriginal right, guaranteed in Treaties, in international law, and in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.<!-- page 199 -->
In particular, the <em>United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples</em> contains a powerful statement on the right to education under community control.<!-- page 199 -->
The Declaration states, “Indigenous peoples have the right to establish and control their educational systems and institutions providing education in their own languages, in a manner appropriate to their cultural methods of teaching and learning.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^39</a><!-- page 199 -->
The Commission believes that fulfilling the promise of the Declaration will be key to overcoming the legacy of the residential schools.<!-- page 199 --></p>

<p>It is not surprising that, faced with terrible conditions and mostly ineffective teaching, many students left school as soon as they could.<!-- page 199 -->
A 2010 study of Aboriginal parents and children living off reserves found that the high school completion rate is lower for former residential school students (28%) than for those who did not attend (36%).<a href="footnote-placeholder">^40</a><!-- page 199 -->
Only 7% of the parents who attended residential school have obtained a university degree, compared with 10% for those Aboriginal parents who had never attended these institutions.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^41</a><!-- page 199 --></p>
<p>Although secondary school graduation rates for all Aboriginal people have improved since the closure of the schools, considerable gaps remain when compared with the rates for the non-Aboriginal population.<!-- page 199 --><!-- page 200 -->
For example, according to the 2006 census, 34% of Aboriginal adults had not graduated from high school, compared with only 15% of their non-Aboriginal counterparts.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^42</a><!-- page 200 -->
In the 2011 census, these numbers improved slightly, with 29% of Aboriginal people not graduating from high school, compared with 12% in the non-Aboriginal population.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^43</a><!-- page 200 --></p>
<p>It is significant that the lowest levels of educational success are in those communities with the highest percentages of descendants of residential school Survivors: First Nations people living on reserves, and Inuit.<!-- page 200 -->
Both groups have a high school completion rate of 41% or less.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^44</a><!-- page 200 --></p>
<p>The statistics for First Nations people living off reserves and for Métis are somewhat better.<!-- page 200 -->
More than 60% of First Nations people living off reserves and 65% to 75% of Métis people have graduated from high school (although these results are still below the national average).<a href="footnote-placeholder">^45</a><!-- page 200 --></p>
<p>Lower educational attainment for the children of Survivors has severely limited their employment and earning potential, just as it did for their parents.<!-- page 200 -->
Aboriginal people have lower median after-tax income, are more likely to experience unemployment, and are more likely to collect employment insurance and social assistance benefits.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^46</a><!-- page 200 -->
This situation is true for all Aboriginal groups, with some variations.<!-- page 200 -->
In 2009, the Métis unemployment rate for persons aged twenty-five to fifty-four was 9.4%, while the non-Aboriginal rate was 7.0%.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^47</a><!-- page 200 -->
In 2006, the Inuit unemployment rate was 19%.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^48</a><!-- page 200 -->
The true rates of unemployment for people living on reserves are difficult to ascertain because of limited data collection.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^49</a><!-- page 200 --></p>
<p>Aboriginal people also have incomes well below their non-Aboriginal counterparts.<!-- page 200 -->
The median income for Aboriginal people in 2006 was 30% lower than the median income for non-Aboriginal workers ($18,962 versus $27,097, respectively).<a href="footnote-placeholder">^50</a><!-- page 200 -->
The gap narrows when Aboriginal people obtain a university degree, which they do at a far lower rate.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^51</a><!-- page 200 -->
Not surprisingly, the child poverty rate for Aboriginal children is also very high—40%, compared with 17% for all children in Canada.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^52</a><!-- page 200 -->
The income gap is pervasive: non-Aboriginal Canadians earn more than Aboriginal workers no matter whether they work on reserves, off reserves, or in urban, rural, or remote locations.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^53</a><!-- page 200 --></p>
<p>The proportion of Aboriginal adults below the poverty line, regardless of age and gender, is much higher than that of non-Aboriginal adults, with differences ranging from 7.8% for adult men aged sixty-five or older, to 22.5% for adult women aged sixty-five or older.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^54</a><!-- page 200 -->
The depth of poverty is also much greater, with Aboriginal people having an average income that falls further below the poverty line on average than that of non-Aboriginal adults, and their poverty is more likely to have persisted for a significant period of time.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^55</a><!-- page 200 --></p>

<p>Present-day Aboriginal education in Canada is made up of a mix of models.<!-- page 201 -->
The federal government funds schools on reserves, with the actual operation of those schools often delegated to the local First Nation.<!-- page 201 -->
Aboriginal children who do not live on reserves are educated through the provincial or territorial school systems.<!-- page 201 -->
In addition, there are a few education systems completely run and managed by First Nations through self-government and other types of intergovernmental agreements.<!-- page 201 --></p>
<p>There are approximately 72,000 students attending 518 First Nation schools.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^56</a><!-- page 201 -->
Despite those numbers, many children must still leave their homes and families behind if they wish to obtain a higher education, even at the high school level.<!-- page 201 --></p>
<p>Since 1973, the Government of Canada has claimed that it is committed to devolving control of education to First Nations people.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^57</a><!-- page 201 -->
However, the interpretation of “Indian control” offered by the Government of Canada bears little resemblance to the vision of First Nations.<!-- page 201 -->
The government’s version of the term has entailed the devolution of federal education programs to First Nations, without the benefit of adequate funding or statutory authority.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^58</a><!-- page 201 -->
Indeed, when devolution began, it was designed to occur without any additional expense.<!-- page 201 -->
This meant that former Indian Affairs-operated schools, which were already substandard compared with provincial norms, were handed over to the First Nation bands to run, but without giving the bands the means to operate them effectively.<!-- page 201 -->
As a result, the curriculum for the majority of First Nation schools is virtually identical to that found in the provincial and territorial schools.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^59</a><!-- page 201 -->
This approach is not significantly different from the approach during the residential school era, when Indigenous communities had no say in the content and language of their children’s schooling.<!-- page 201 --></p>
<p>The funding formula for First Nations schools was last updated in 1996, and does not take into account the range of basic and contemporary education components needed to deliver a good-quality education in the twenty-first century, such as information and communication technologies, sports and recreation, language proficiency, and library services.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^60</a><!-- page 201 -->
Worse still, since 1996, funding growth for First Nations education has been capped at 2%, an amount that has been insufficient to keep pace with either inflation or the rapid increases in the Aboriginal student population.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^61</a><!-- page 201 -->
Meanwhile, between 1996 and 2006, funding to provincial and territorial school systems increased annually by 3.8%, almost double the increase for reserve schools.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^62</a><!-- page 201 -->
The underfunding of reserve schools likely violates Treaty promises about education, and makes it very difficult to overcome the educational and consequent income gaps.<!-- page 201 --><!-- page 202 --></p>
<p>In many cases, the fees that First Nations are charged when they send their children to provincial schools are higher than the amount of funding they receive from Canada per student.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^63</a><!-- page 202 --></p>

<p>Since 2011, three major reports on First Nations education have concluded that the status quo is unacceptable and that there is a need for a complete restructuring based on principles of self-government, a culturally relevant curriculum, and stable funding.<!-- page 202 -->
All three reports agree that Aboriginal peoples themselves must lead and control the process of change.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^64</a><!-- page 202 --></p>
<p>In October 2013, the government released the text of the proposed First Nations Education Act.<!-- page 202 -->
The bill itself provided no guarantee of increased or stable funding of First Nations schools, leaving such matters to be resolved through regulations, with no assurance of equity in the distribution of resources to educate First Nations children in First Nations schools or in provincial schools.<!-- page 202 -->
In February 2014, the Government of Canada and the Assembly of First Nations announced an agreement on a new basis for First Nations education reform and legislation.<!-- page 202 -->
The agreement called for over $2 billion in new funding to reserve schools, and replaced the 2% cap on annual increases with a 4.5% annual increase and $1.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^25</a><!-- page 202 -->
billion from 2016–17 to 2018–19.<!-- page 202 -->
However, after opposition from Aboriginal leaders, the proposed legislation was put on hold, pending agreement on the principles for a new Act.<!-- page 202 --></p>
<p>Based on all that it has heard from thousands of former students and family members throughout the country, the Commission is convinced that such an Act must recognize the importance of education in strengthening the cultural identity of Aboriginal people and providing a better basis for success.<!-- page 202 --><!-- page 203 -->
Albert Marshall, a former student of the Shubenacadie residential school in Nova Scotia, made this point forcefully to the Commission.<!-- page 203 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The current education system has been designed to completely eradicate who I am and to kill that Indian Mi’kmaq spirit that’s in me.<!-- page 203 -->
But I do know I need knowledge and I need education.<!-- page 203 -->
But the kind of education I need has to be reflective of who I am as a Mi’kmaq.<!-- page 203 -->
And that knowledge that I get, that I will receive, I have a responsibility with that knowledge to pass it down so others will benefit from it…<!-- page 203 -->
The kind of legacy that I want to leave my children in the future generations is one of which they will be able to excel, they will be able to compete without having to worry about is the education system going to further eradicate their selves.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^65</a><!-- page 203 --></p>

<p>Provincial and territorial schools are the only option for Métis students, other Aboriginal children without recognized status, and those First Nation and Inuit children who do not live on reserves or who do live on reserves but attend provincial schools.<!-- page 203 -->
Their educational outcomes are not significantly better than those who attend First Nation schools on reserves or in their home communities.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^66</a><!-- page 203 -->
Jurisdictional disputes between the federal and provincial governments over responsibility for Métis education continue to be a major obstacle to ensuring that Métis people have control over the education of their young people.<!-- page 203 --><!-- page 204 -->
The Métis remain without recognized jurisdiction and authority even though they have equal protection under Section 35 of the Constitution.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^67</a><!-- page 204 -->
The result is that Métis children generally are educated in public or Catholic school systems in which school boards are not specifically held accountable for the education needs of Métis children.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^68</a><!-- page 204 -->
The Commission believes all levels of government should consult with Métis parents, communities, and national organizations to provide Métis-specific educational programming.<!-- page 204 --></p>
<p>Inuit students face one of the largest gaps in terms of educational attainment.<!-- page 204 -->
A disproportionately high number of northern parents are residential school Survivors or intergenerational Survivors.<!-- page 204 -->
Inuit are among Canada’s youngest citizens, with a median age of twenty-two.<!-- page 204 -->
In response to the intense needs of its young population, Inuit peoples have been leading the way to dramatic change.<!-- page 204 -->
Inuit education is on the cusp of significant transformation, with some of the most promising models for self-governing education coming out of northern communities.<!-- page 204 -->
But these changes have not been without obstacles.<!-- page 204 -->
Some regions have a greater capacity to develop the necessary resources than others.<!-- page 204 -->
A shortage of bilingual educators is one of the greatest barriers to expanding bilingual education in Inuit schools.<!-- page 204 -->
There is also a lack of teaching and reading materials in Inuit languages.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^69</a><!-- page 204 --></p>
<p>Another major problem is the lack of supports both within and outside the education system that are necessary to ensure student success.<!-- page 204 -->
Inuit educators have long recognized that it is important to begin working with children as early as possible, but the North lacks good-quality daycare and preschool spaces.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^70</a><!-- page 204 --></p>

<p>To help close the income and employment gap, Aboriginal people need increased access to post-secondary education.<!-- page 204 -->
Only 8.7% of First Nations people, 5.1% of Inuit, and 11.7% of Métis have a university degree, according to the 2011 census.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^71</a><!-- page 204 -->
The federal auditor general has commented: “In 2004, we noted that at existing rates, it would take 28 years for First Nations communities to reach the national average.<!-- page 204 -->
More recent trends suggest that the time needed may be still longer.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^72</a><!-- page 204 -->
The barriers to post-secondary education have had profound effects.<!-- page 204 -->
Geraldine Bob attended residential school at Kamloops, British Columbia.<!-- page 204 -->
She told the Commission at a Community Hearing in Fort Simpson, Northwest Territories, that poor education and negative experiences at residential school delayed her attendance at university and her entry into the workforce as a teacher.<!-- page 204 -->
She suggested that<!-- page 204 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>the residential school system owes me those lost years.<!-- page 204 -->
You know, I lost my retirement; I have to keep working, I don’t have a good retirement fund because it was so late when I went to school.<!-- page 204 -->
And I’ve proven that I can go to university and be successful as a teacher.<!-- page 204 --><!-- page 205 -->
So …<!-- page 205 -->
that little tiny bit of Common Experience Payment doesn’t compensate for all that loss.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^73</a><!-- page 205 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Almost no one with some university or college education who spoke to the Commission had been able to obtain that education directly after high school.<!-- page 205 -->
Most, like Geraldine Bob, had lost years to the time it took them to heal enough to even consider the possibility of upgrading their schooling.<!-- page 205 --></p>
<p>If access to post-secondary education is to be improved, increasing the rates of secondary school completion is an important step.<!-- page 205 -->
But even for those who qualify for a university program, there are significant obstacles.<!-- page 205 -->
Federal funding for post-secondary education suffers from the same 2% funding cap that has been imposed on elementary and secondary schools since 1996.<!-- page 205 -->
The First Nations Education Council estimates that there is a backlog of over 10,000 First Nations students waiting for post-secondary funding, with an additional $234 million required to erase that backlog and meet current demands.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^74</a><!-- page 205 -->
The financial barriers and other difficulties that Aboriginal people face in attending post-secondary institutions deprive the Canadian workforce of the social workers, teachers, health-care workers, tradespeople, legal professionals, and others who can help address the legacy of residential schools.<!-- page 205 --></p>

<p>In a study of the impact of residential schools, the Assembly of First Nations noted in 1994 that<!-- page 206 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>language is necessary to define and maintain a world view.<!-- page 206 -->
For this reason, some First Nation elders to this day will say that knowing or learning the native language is basic to any deep understanding of a First Nation way of life, to being a First Nation person.<!-- page 206 -->
For them, a First Nation world is quite simply not possible without its own language.<!-- page 206 -->
For them, the impact of residential school silencing their language is equivalent to a residential school silencing their world.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^76</a><!-- page 206 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples similarly noted the connection between Aboriginal languages and what it called a “distinctive world view, rooted in the stories of ancestors and the environment.”<!-- page 206 -->
The Royal Commission added that Aboriginal languages are a “tangible emblem of group identity” that can provide “the individual a sense of security and continuity with the past …<!-- page 206 -->
maintenance of the language and group identity has both a social-emotional and a spiritual purpose.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^77</a><!-- page 206 --></p>
<p>Residential schools were a systematic, government-sponsored attempt to destroy Aboriginal cultures and languages and to assimilate Aboriginal peoples so that they no longer existed as distinct peoples.<!-- page 206 -->
English and, to a far lesser degree, French were the only languages permitted to be used in most schools.<!-- page 206 -->
Students were punished—often severely—for speaking their own languages.<!-- page 206 -->
Michael Sillett, a former student at the North West River residential school in Newfoundland and Labrador, told the Commission, “Children at the dorm were not allowed to speak their mother tongue.<!-- page 206 -->
I remember several times when other children were slapped or had their mouths washed out for speaking their mother tongue; whether it was Inuktitut or Innu-aimun.<!-- page 206 -->
Residents were admonished for just being Native.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^78</a><!-- page 206 -->
As late as the 1970s, students at schools in northwestern Ontario were not allowed to speak their language if they were in the presence of a staff member who could not understand that language.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^79</a><!-- page 206 -->
Conrad Burns, whose father attended the Prince Albert school, named this policy for what it was: “It was a cultural genocide.<!-- page 206 -->
People were beaten for their language, people were beaten because …<!-- page 206 -->
they followed their own ways.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^80</a><!-- page 206 --></p>
<p>Rights to culture and language, and the need for remedies for their loss, have long been recognized in international law.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^81</a><!-- page 206 -->
They are specifically acknowledged in the <em>United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples</em>, which has recognized the critical state of Aboriginal languages.<!-- page 206 --><!-- page 207 -->
Article 8:1 of the Declaration recognizes that “Indigenous peoples and individuals have the right not to be subjected to forced assimilation or destruction of their culture.”<!-- page 207 -->
Article 8:2 provides that “states shall provide effective mechanisms for prevention of and redress for any form of forced assimilation or integration.”<!-- page 207 --></p>
<p>The Declaration also includes specific recognition of the right to revitalize and transmit Aboriginal languages in Article 13:1, which recognizes that “Indigenous peoples have the right to revitalize, use, develop and transmit to future generations their histories, languages, oral traditions, philosophies, writing systems and literatures, and to designate and retain their own names for communities, places and persons.”<!-- page 207 -->
Article 14 provides for educational language rights of the type that Canadians already know and experience, with respect to anglophone and francophone minorities.<!-- page 207 -->
Article 14:1 provides similarly that “Indigenous peoples have the right to establish and control their educational systems and institutions providing education in their own languages, in a manner appropriate to their cultural methods of teaching and learning,” and Article 14:3 provides: “States shall, in conjunction with indigenous peoples, take effective measures, in order for indigenous individuals, particularly children, including those living outside their communities, to have access, when possible, to an education in their own culture and provided in their own language.”<!-- page 207 -->
Article 16 provides that Indigenous peoples “have the right to establish their own media in their own languages and to have access to all forms of non-indigenous media without discrimination,” and that states “shall take effective measures to ensure that Stateowned media duly reflect indigenous cultural diversity.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^82</a><!-- page 207 --></p>
<p>The attempt to assimilate students by denying them access to, and respect for, their Aboriginal language and culture often meant that the students became estranged from their families and communities.<!-- page 207 -->
Agnes Mills, a former student at All Saints residential school in Saskatchewan, told the Commission her story.<!-- page 207 --></p>

<p>And one of the things that residential school did for me, I really regret, is that it made me ashamed of who I was…<!-- page 207 -->
And I wanted to be white so bad, and the worst thing I ever did was I was ashamed of my mother, that honourable woman, because she couldn’t speak English.<!-- page 207 -->
She never went to school, and they told us that, we used to go home to her on Saturdays, and they told us that we couldn’t talk Gwich’in to her and, and she couldn’t, like couldn’t communicate.<!-- page 207 -->

<p>Some Survivors refused to teach their own children their Aboriginal languages and cultures because of the negative stigma that had come to be associated with them during their school years.<!-- page 208 -->
This has contributed significantly to the fragile state of Aboriginal languages in Canada today.<!-- page 208 --></p>
<p>Many of the almost ninety surviving Aboriginal languages in Canada are under serious threat of extinction.<!-- page 208 -->
In the 2011 census, 14.5% of the Aboriginal population reported that their first language learned was an Aboriginal language.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^85</a><!-- page 208 -->
In the previous 2006 census, 18% of those who identified as Aboriginal had reported an Aboriginal language as their first language learned, and a decade earlier, in the 1996 census, the figure was 26%.<!-- page 208 -->
This indicates nearly a 50% drop in the fifteen years since the last residential schools closed.<!-- page 208 -->
There are, however, variations among Aboriginal peoples: 63.7% of Inuit speak their Indigenous language, compared with 22.4% of First Nations people and only 2.5% of Métis people.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^86</a><!-- page 208 --></p>
<p>Some languages are close to extinction because they have only a few remaining speakers of the great-grandparent generation.<!-- page 208 -->
The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) lists 36% of Canada’s Aboriginal languages as being critically endangered, in the sense that they are used only by great-grandparent generations; 18% are severely endangered, in the sense that they are used by the great-grandparent and grandparent generations; and 16% are definitely endangered, in the sense that they are used by the parental and the two previous generations.<!-- page 208 -->
The remaining languages are all vulnerable.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^87</a><!-- page 208 -->
If the preservation of Aboriginal languages does not become a priority both for governments and for Aboriginal communities, then what the residential schools failed to accomplish will come about through a process of systematic neglect.<!-- page 208 --></p>

<p>At a time when government funding is most needed to protect Aboriginal languages and culture, Canada has not upheld commitments it previously made to fund such programs.<!-- page 209 -->
In 2002, the federal government promised $160 million for the creation of a centre for Aboriginal languages and culture and a national language strategy.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^89</a><!-- page 209 -->
But, in 2006, the government retreated from that commitment, pledging instead to spend $5 million per year in “permanent funding” for the Aboriginal Languages Initiative (ALI), which had been started in 1998.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^90</a><!-- page 209 -->
The ALI is a program of government-administered heritage subsidies.<!-- page 209 -->
It is not based on the notion of respectful nation-to-nation relations between Canada and Aboriginal peoples.<!-- page 209 -->
Neither does it provide Aboriginal people with the opportunity to make decisions for themselves about how to allocate scarce resources and how to administer programs.<!-- page 209 -->
Many who appeared before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada were skeptical about the government’s commitment to preserve Aboriginal languages.<!-- page 209 -->
As Michael Sillett told us, “I cannot see the federal government putting out the money that’s necessary for full restitution, you know…<!-- page 209 -->
I can’t bring back my language; I lost that.<!-- page 209 -->
I lost my culture, you know.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^91</a><!-- page 209 --></p>
<p>Other than ALI, the only significant programs for language preservation are the CanadaTerritorial Language Accords ($4.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^1</a><!-- page 209 -->
million annual budget), which support territorial government-directed Aboriginal language services, supports, and community projects in Nunavut and the Northwest Territories.<!-- page 209 -->
In Yukon, language revitalization and preservation projects are supported through transfer agreements with ten of the eleven self-governing Yukon First Nations.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^92</a><!-- page 209 --></p>
<p>The combined total annual federal budget for these Aboriginal languages programs is $9.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^1</a><!-- page 209 -->
million.<!-- page 209 -->
By way of comparison, the Official Languages Program for English and French is projected to receive funding as follows:<!-- page 209 --></p>
<ul>
<li>2012–13: $353.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^3</a><!-- page 209 -->
million<!-- page 209 --></li>
<li>2013–14: $348.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^2</a><!-- page 209 -->
million<!-- page 209 --></li>
<li>2014–15: $348.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^2</a><!-- page 209 -->
million93<!-- page 209 --></li>
</ul>
<p>The resources committed to Aboriginal language programs are far fewer than what is committed to French in areas where French speakers are in the minority.<!-- page 209 -->
For example, the federal government provides support to the small minority of francophones in Nunavut in the amount of approximately $4,000 per individual annually.<!-- page 209 -->
In contrast, funding to support Inuit-language initiatives is estimated at $44 per Inuk per year.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^94</a><!-- page 209 --></p>
<p>The Commission believes that a multi-pronged approach to Aboriginal language preservation—if implemented, honourably resourced, and sustained— might prevent further increase in the litigation of Aboriginal language rights, and the increased international criticism of Canada’s policy towards Aboriginal-language rights.<!-- page 209 -->
This approach will require full, good-faith consultation, which recognizes that although Aboriginal communities have the necessary knowledge, particularly among their Elders, to preserve their own languages, additional support is needed.<!-- page 209 --><!-- page 210 -->
The outcome of the consultation should be legislation and policies that affirm the importance of Canada’s Indigenous languages, and allocate adequate funding to ensure their preservation.<!-- page 210 --></p>

The commissioner should help promote Aboriginal languages and report on the adequacy of federal funding of Aboriginal-languages initiatives.<!-- page 210 --></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In addition to promoting the use of Aboriginal languages, an Aboriginal Languages Commissioner would also educate non-Aboriginal Canadians about the richness and value of Aboriginal languages and how strengthening those languages can enhance Canada’s international reputation.<!-- page 210 --></p>
<p>Aboriginal people recognize how important it is for their children to speak and understand an Aboriginal language.<!-- page 210 -->
Sabrina Williams, an intergenerational Survivor from British Columbia, expressed that need.<!-- page 210 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I didn’t realize until taking this language class how much we have lost—all the things that are attached to language: it’s family connections, it’s oral history, it’s traditions, it’s ways of being, it’s ways of knowing, it’s medicine, it’s song, it’s dance, it’s memory.<!-- page 210 -->

<p>Language instruction may require innovative approaches, including the use of Elders and others as teachers and the use of immersion programs.<!-- page 210 -->
Education institutions must be flexible and responsive in their attempts to encourage the teaching of Aboriginal languages.<!-- page 210 --><!-- page 211 -->

<p>As a result of the residential school experience, many Aboriginal people lost their language and lost touch with their culture.<!-- page 211 -->
Many also suffered a loss of a different sort.<!-- page 211 -->
It was common for residential school officials to give students new names.<!-- page 211 -->
At the Aklavik Anglican school in the Northwest Territories, a young Inuit girl named Masak became “Alice”—she would not hear her old name until she returned home.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^96</a><!-- page 211 -->
At the Qu’Appelle school in Saskatchewan, Ochankugahe (Path Maker) became Daniel Kennedy, named for the biblical Daniel, and Adélard Standing Buffalo was named for Adélard Langevin, the Archbishop of St.<!-- page 211 -->
Boniface.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^97</a><!-- page 211 -->
Survivors and their families who have sought to reclaim the names that were taken from them in residential schools have found the process to be both expensive and time consuming.<!-- page 211 -->

<p>Residential schools endangered the health and well-being of the children who attended them.<!-- page 211 -->
Many students succumbed to infectious disease, particularly tuberculosis.<!-- page 211 -->
Sexual and physical abuse, as well as separation from families and communities, caused lasting trauma for many others.<!-- page 211 -->
The effects of this trauma were often passed on to the children of the residential school Survivors and sometimes to their grandchildren.<!-- page 211 --><!-- page 212 -->
Residential schools also posed a threat to the mental health of students through the pervasive assumptions and assertions they made about the inferiority of Aboriginal peoples, cultures, and languages.<!-- page 212 -->
This disregard for Aboriginal health and well-being was consistent with the long-established patterns of colonialism: the introduction of new diseases, the disruption of traditional food sources, and the concentration of people on unproductive land and the housing of them in cramped, unsanitary dwellings.<!-- page 212 --></p>
<p>The schools undermined Aboriginal health by failing to feed and clothe the children properly and housing them in poorly constructed and dangerous buildings.<!-- page 212 -->
The schools did not properly screen out sick and infectious children, and often lacked adequate treatment facilities.<!-- page 212 -->
As Ruby Firth, a former student at Stringer Hall in the Northwest Territories, told the Commission, those conditions had a lasting effect.<!-- page 212 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’ve got chronic bronchitis today.<!-- page 212 -->
Every winter I get pneumonia like two or three times and I’m on two puffers ’cause when I was in Stringer Hall residential school they used to put us in these little skinny red coats that weren’t even warm enough for winter.<!-- page 212 -->
And we used to have to walk across the street to go to school…<!-- page 212 -->
Both my lungs are 50% scarred from having pneumonia seven times in [residential school].<!-- page 212 -->
That’s always going to be there, it’s never going to go away.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^98</a><!-- page 212 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There were also lasting psychological and emotional impacts.<!-- page 212 -->
Sonia Wuttunee-Byrd described the damage that residential school caused her.<!-- page 212 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I lost my braids, my beautiful hair was cut, and I felt like my identity was so confused, I didn’t know who I was.<!-- page 212 -->
What is even worse is that they started to sexually take advantage of me and abuse me, not one, not two, but many, many people for a very long time, until I was sixteen.<!-- page 212 -->
I started to really deteriorate.<!-- page 212 -->
I became very sick and anorexic, and really started to go downhill.<!-- page 212 -->
At one point I only weighed sixty-six pounds, and that was it, I had no desire to live.<!-- page 212 -->
The doctor said, “You have a month to live, go home.”<!-- page 212 -->
He said to my family, “Take her home, she is going to die.”…<!-- page 212 -->
I would say to Mom and Dad, and they never understood why I was crying.<!-- page 212 -->
The school always said, “Sonia is a fantastic student, she is doing so well,” but inside it was torment.<!-- page 212 -->
I held everything in and didn’t tell anybody for twenty years.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^99</a><!-- page 212 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Katherine Copenace, a former student at the St.<!-- page 212 -->
Mary’s residential school in Ontario, told the Commission about her struggles.<!-- page 212 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The residential school students suffered physical, sexual, spiritual, and most of all emotional abuse and my dad used to say to me, “Emotional abuse is more damaging than physical abuse.<!-- page 212 -->
Your physical hurts heal.”<!-- page 212 -->
That’s what he used to say.<!-- page 212 -->
When I got older, I had thoughts of suicide, inflicting pain on myself which I did.<!-- page 212 -->
I used to slash my arms, pierce my arms, my body and I destroyed myself with alcohol which the government introduced of course.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^100</a><!-- page 212 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The children in residential schools were powerless to take healing measures.<!-- page 213 -->
They were denied access to traditional foods and to families, traditional healers, and communities who could have helped them, according to Aboriginal ways, to deal with the physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual elements of ill health.<!-- page 213 -->
Because of the isolated location of many of the schools, students were also often denied access to ‘Western’ doctors and nurses.<!-- page 213 -->
This double denial of health care, based in government policy, continues to this day, due to the relative isolation of many Aboriginal communities, many of which have no road access, and limited access to local health resources.<!-- page 213 --></p>
<p>Health care is a right enshrined in international and constitutional law as well as in Treaties.<!-- page 213 -->
The <em>United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples</em> recognizes that Indigenous peoples have the right to physical and mental integrity, as well as the right to equal enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health.<!-- page 213 -->
In taking measures to achieve these goals, states are obligated to pay particular attention to the rights and special needs of Elders, women, youth, children, and persons with disabilities.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^101</a><!-- page 213 -->
Indigenous peoples have the right to be actively involved in developing, determining, and administering health programs that affect them.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^102</a><!-- page 213 -->
Indigenous peoples also have the right to traditional medicines and to maintain their traditional health practices.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^103</a><!-- page 213 --></p>
<p>The Numbered Treaties also established additional legal obligations concerning Aboriginal health and wellness.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^104</a><!-- page 213 -->
The right to medical care was recognized in Treaties 6, 7, 8, 10, and 11.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^105</a><!-- page 213 -->
Treaty 6 explicitly included provision of a “medicine chest” and relief from “pestilence.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^106</a><!-- page 213 -->
However, the right to health is not limited to these Treaties.<!-- page 213 -->
The Treaty negotiations included many references to the protection of, and non-interference with, traditional ways of life.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^107</a><!-- page 213 --></p>

<p>From 2004 to 2008, the “age-specific mortality rate” at ages one to nineteen in the Inuit homelands was 188.0 deaths per 100,000 person-years at risk, compared with only 35.3 deaths per 100,000 in the rest of Canada.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^109</a><!-- page 214 --></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>First Nations people aged forty-five and older have nearly twice the rate of diabetes as the non-Aboriginal population.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^110</a><!-- page 214 --></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>First Nations people were six times more likely than the general population to suffer alcohol-related deaths, and more than three times more likely to suffer drug-induced deaths.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^111</a><!-- page 214 --></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The overall suicide rate among First Nation communities is about twice that of the total Canadian population.<!-- page 214 -->
For Inuit, the rate is still higher: six to eleven times the rate for the general population.<!-- page 214 -->

The most complete information about comparative health outcomes is out of date, much of it coming from the 1990s.<!-- page 214 -->
Unlike in other countries, the Canadian government has not provided a comprehensive list of well-being indicators comparing Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal populations.<!-- page 214 -->
The lack of accessible data on comparable health indicators means that these issues receive less public, media, and political attention.<!-- page 214 -->
In Australia, the government has set a timeline for closing the gap in health outcomes between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal citizens.<!-- page 214 -->
The Australian prime minister reports annually on the progress being made to close the gaps in targets related to life expectancy and mortality rates for Indigenous children.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^113</a><!-- page 214 -->

<li>We call upon the federal government, in consultation with Aboriginal peoples, to establish measurable goals to identify and close the gaps in health outcomes between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal communities, and to publish annual progress reports and assess long-term trends.<!-- page 214 -->
Such efforts would focus on indicators such as: infant mortality, maternal health, suicide, mental health, addictions, life expectancy, birth rates, infant and child health issues, chronic diseases, illness and injury incidence, and the availability of appropriate health services.<!-- page 214 --></li>
</ol>
<p>In 2003, the First Ministers’ Accord on Health Care Renewal recognized the obvious: that Aboriginal peoples face serious health challenges.<!-- page 214 -->
The accord committed to making the reduction of the gap in health status between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal peoples a national priority.<!-- page 214 --><!-- page 215 -->
More than a decade later, that gap remains.<!-- page 215 -->
In fact, the federal government has moved backwards on issues of Aboriginal health since the signing of the Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement and Canada’s apology to Survivors.<!-- page 215 -->
It has terminated funding to a number of Aboriginal health organizations, including the Aboriginal Healing Foundation and the National Aboriginal Health Organization.<!-- page 215 -->
These organizations were committed to models of research and treatment in which Aboriginal communities have ownership, control, access, and possession.<!-- page 215 -->
Their loss significantly limits the development of accurate information about health issues and solutions under Aboriginal control.<!-- page 215 -->
Health Canada has also cut funding for a number of Aboriginal primary health programs, including programs that address diabetes, fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, youth suicide, infectious diseases, and maternal and child health.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^114</a><!-- page 215 -->
These cuts have had a serious impact on Aboriginal communities.<!-- page 215 --></p>

However, an holistic approach to health is common to many Aboriginal cultures and has also been increasingly validated by ‘Western’ medicine.<!-- page 216 -->
A belief shared among many Inuit, Métis, and First Nation people is that a sacred connection exists among people, the Earth, and everything above it, upon it, and within it.<!-- page 216 -->
For purposes of healing, this means activities such as “on-the-land” or “bush” healing camps where participants can experience the healing power of the natural world.<!-- page 216 -->
Traditional practices can also include sweat lodges, cedar baths, smudging, the lighting of the Qulliq (a stone lamp used by the Inuit for ceremonial purposes), and other spiritual ceremonies.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^117</a><!-- page 216 -->

<p>Residential schools inflicted profound injustices on Aboriginal people.<!-- page 217 -->
Aboriginal parents were forced, often under pressure from the police, to give up their children to the schools.<!-- page 217 -->
Children were taken far from their communities to live in frightening custodial institutions, which felt like prisons.<!-- page 217 -->
The children who attended residential schools were often treated as if they were offenders and were often victimized.<!-- page 217 --></p>
<p>This pattern of disproportionate imprisonment and victimization of Aboriginal people continues to this day.<!-- page 217 -->
The continued failure of the justice system denies Aboriginal people the safety and opportunities that most Canadians take for granted.<!-- page 217 -->
Redress to the racist and colonial views that inspired the schools, and effective and long-term solutions to the crime problems that plague too many Aboriginal communities, call for increased use of Aboriginal justice, based on Aboriginal laws and healing practices.<!-- page 217 --></p>
<p>To understand the full legacy of the harms of the schools, it is important to examine how the Canadian legal system responded to residential school abuse.<!-- page 218 -->
Relatively few prosecutions for abuse resulted from police investigations.<!-- page 218 -->
In some cases, the federal government actually compromised these investigations—and the independence of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP)—to defend its own position in civil cases brought against it by residential school Survivors.<!-- page 218 --></p>
<section class="section3" id="rcmp-independence-compromised"><h3><a class="toclink" href="#rcmp-independence-compromised">RCMP independence compromised<!-- page 218 --></a></h3>
<p>In late 1994, the RCMP established the E Division Task Force to investigate allegations of abuse in British Columbia residential schools.<!-- page 218 -->
There is evidence, however, that RCMP investigations into abuse were adversely influenced by the federal government’s strategic interests in defending itself in the many civil lawsuits commenced by former students.<!-- page 218 -->
For example, the government demanded that the RCMP hand over its investigation files related to abuse at the Kuper Island school.<!-- page 218 -->
Despite some initial objections, the RCMP eventually did turn over the files.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^118</a><!-- page 218 -->
This was done without due regard for the privacy rights of the complainants in the case, and, in effect, gave the government an advantage in defending itself.<!-- page 218 -->
When the police force requested the return of these files, the government declined, and then further refused to disclose the information it had received to the Survivors who had brought the civil lawsuits.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^119</a><!-- page 218 --></p>
<p>Affidavits filed by RCMP officers suggest that the federal government’s interest in defending itself in civil litigation interfered with police investigations into crimes committed at the residential schools.<!-- page 218 -->
Although a judge eventually ordered that Survivors should have the same access to RCMP criminal investigation material regarding offences at the Kuper Island school as the government, the whole affair meant Survivors could reasonably conclude that the RCMP was acting as an agent of the federal government, rather than as an impartial enforcer of the law.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^120</a><!-- page 218 --></p>

<p>The RCMP E Division Task Force final report notes that “a very common situation that kept occurring over and over again” was that Crown counsel refused to prosecute without corroboration in the form of physical evidence.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^121</a><!-- page 218 --><!-- page 219 -->
This approach was based on an unwillingness to take the complainant’s own evidence as sufficient to justify a prosecution.<!-- page 219 -->
It betrays an unwillingness to take the evidence of Aboriginal people as being worthy of belief.<!-- page 219 -->
At best, the refusal to prosecute without corroboration was based on a belief that the denial of any accused person who occupied a position of authority at the schools would be sufficient to create a reasonable doubt about guilt.<!-- page 219 --></p>
<p>Since 1982, the requirement for corroboration was specifically dropped for sexual offences, and it was never required for non-sexual offences.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^122</a><!-- page 219 -->
The Commission is concerned that a continued insistence on corroboration has resulted in discriminatory treatment of Aboriginal victims.<!-- page 219 --></p>
</section><section class="section3" id="few-criminal-prosecutions"><h3><a class="toclink" href="#few-criminal-prosecutions">Few criminal prosecutions<!-- page 219 --></a></h3>
<p>The Commission has been able to identify fewer than fifty convictions stemming from allegations of abuse at residential schools.<!-- page 219 -->
This figure is insignificant compared with the nearly 38,000 claims of sexual and serious physical abuse that were submitted as part of the Independent Assessment Process (IAP), set up under the Settlement Agreement.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^123</a><!-- page 219 --></p>
<p>Although there were not many prosecutions for sexual abuse, there were even fewer charges of physical abuse brought against former school staff.<!-- page 219 -->
The RCMP’s own report suggests that the E Division Task Force viewed physical assaults against Aboriginal children as being less serious than sexual abuse.<!-- page 219 -->
The RCMP attributed complaints by former students about assaults as evidence of a “culture clash between the rigid, ‘spare the rod, spoil the child’ Christian attitude, and the more permissive Native tradition of child-rearing.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^124</a><!-- page 219 -->
This preconception undoubtedly affected the number of prosecutions that occurred for physical abuse at the schools.<!-- page 219 --></p>
</section><section class="section3" id="civil-litigation"><h3><a class="toclink" href="#civil-litigation">Civil litigation<!-- page 219 --></a></h3>
<p>Having generally failed to find justice through police investigations and criminal prosecutions, residential school Survivors increasingly turned to the civil justice system in the 1990s, bringing lawsuits against abusers as well as the federal government and the churches that operated the schools.<!-- page 219 -->
The Canadian legal system, however, was prepared to consider only some of the harms that the Survivors suffered—generally, those harms caused by sexual and sometimes physical abuse.<!-- page 219 -->
It refused to consider on the merits the Survivors’ claims relating to loss of language, culture, family attachment, and violation of Treaty rights to education.<!-- page 219 -->
The Canadian legal system refused to consider the claims that Survivors brought on behalf of their parents and their children.<!-- page 219 -->
It also refused to provide remedies for the collective harms that residential schools caused to Aboriginal nations and communities.<!-- page 219 --><!-- page 220 --></p>
<p>Residential school litigation has been extremely complex, expensive, and lengthy.<!-- page 220 -->
It has been especially difficult for the Survivors, many of whom were revictimized through explicit questioning and adversarial treatment by the Government of Canada, the churches, and even their own lawyers.<!-- page 220 --></p>
</section><section class="section3" id="limitation-periods"><h3><a class="toclink" href="#limitation-periods">Limitation periods<!-- page 220 --></a></h3>
<p>Within the Canadian justice system, complainants in civil proceedings have a limited period of time in which to file suit.<!-- page 220 -->
If they wait too long after the harm they have suffered, they may not be allowed to pursue their claim because of a provincial statute of limitation.<!-- page 220 -->
Although statutes of limitation can protect defendants in civil lawsuits, they can also have the effect of denying plaintiffs the opportunity to have the truth of their allegation determined in court.<!-- page 220 -->
This is most dramatically true for child victims, who have neither the means nor the knowledge to pursue claims of harm until much later, when the time period for a claim may very well have run out.<!-- page 220 --></p>
<p>A statute of limitation defence has to be raised by the defendant.<!-- page 220 -->
In its 2000 report on responding to child abuse in institutions, the Law Commission of Canada recommended that the federal government should not rely solely on statute of limitation defences.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^125</a><!-- page 220 -->
Nevertheless, the Government of Canada and the churches have frequently and successfully raised these defences in residential school litigation.<!-- page 220 -->
The Commission believes that the federal government’s successful use of statute of limitation defences has meant that Canadian courts and Canadians in general have considered only a small part of the harms of residential schools, mostly those caused by sexual abuse.<!-- page 220 -->
Some provinces have amended their limitation statutes to enable civil prosecutions for a wider range of offences.<!-- page 220 -->
We urge others to follow suit.<!-- page 220 --></p>

<p>The criminal prosecution of abusers in residential schools and the subsequent civil lawsuits were a difficult experience for Survivors.<!-- page 221 -->
The courtroom experience was made worse by the fact that many lawyers did not have adequate cultural, historical, or psychological knowledge to deal with the painful memories that the Survivors were forced to reveal.<!-- page 221 -->
The lack of sensitivity that lawyers often demonstrated in dealing with residential school Survivors resulted, in some cases, in the Survivors’ not receiving appropriate legal service.<!-- page 221 -->

<p>During the 1990s, the number of civil lawsuits against Canada and the churches that ran the schools steadily increased.<!-- page 221 -->
Many of these claims were combined into class actions that were certified by provincial courts.<!-- page 221 -->
In May 2005, the Government of Canada appointed former Supreme Court Justice Frank Iacobucci as its chief negotiator to help reach a settlement agreement among the many parties involved in litigation: representatives from Aboriginal communities, church groups, the federal government, and Survivors represented by various law firms.<!-- page 221 -->
The parties reached an agreement in principle in November 2005.<!-- page 221 -->
The details of the Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement were finalized and approved by the federal cabinet on May 10, 2006.  The thousands of legal claims made against the federal government and the churches were concluded and settled under the terms of the Settlement Agreement.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^126</a><!-- page 221 --></p>
<p>Because the Settlement Agreement would involve the termination of a number of class-action proceedings that the courts had already authorized, it was necessary for courts in most provinces and territories to consider whether the Settlement Agreement was a fair resolution of the claims and, in particular, whether it adequately protected the interests of all the class members.<!-- page 222 --></p>
<p>The Settlement Agreement included a Common Experience Payment (CEP) for everyone who attended one of the residential schools listed in the Agreement.<!-- page 222 -->
In addition to the CEP, an Independent Assessment Process (IAP) was established to pay compensation to those who suffered sexual or serious physical assaults, such as severe beating, whipping, and second-degree burning, at the schools.<!-- page 222 -->
The process also included compensation for assaults by other students if they were the result of a lack of reasonable supervision.<!-- page 222 --></p>
<p>The IAP was designed to be an easier process for complainants than litigation.<!-- page 222 -->
Hearings are held in private with cultural supports for the claimants and health supports provided by Health Canada.<!-- page 222 -->
In contrast to the protracted nature of much civil litigation, hearings are supposed to be held within nine months, with decisions due shortly after the hearings.<!-- page 222 --></p>
<p>In their statements to the Commission, some Survivors have expressed concerns about the IAP abuse hearing process because it did not allow them to face their abusers directly.<!-- page 222 -->
Bernard Catcheway, a former student at Pine Creek residential school in Manitoba, told the Commission,<!-- page 222 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>You know and [my abuser’s] still alive.<!-- page 222 -->
I think she’s eighty-nine years old according to when I went to my hearing three years ago.<!-- page 222 -->
I wanted her so badly to come to that hearing, you know, but because of her age and because of her, I guess, incompetency, you know, she chose not to be there.<!-- page 222 -->
I would have loved for her to, to meet her at that time, to basically say I, you know, to say whatever it was that made her do things to us, I was going to say, “I forgive you.”<!-- page 222 -->
But I never got a chance to say that.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^127</a><!-- page 222 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Other claimants, such as Amelia Galligos-Thomas, a former student at Sechelt residential school in British Columbia, criticized the IAP’s delay in hearing and settling claims.<!-- page 222 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’ve been waiting five years now for my appeal, and it hasn’t happened yet.<!-- page 222 -->
And it’s almost time for them to stop giving the money out to us.<!-- page 222 -->

<p>The dramatic overrepresentation of Aboriginal people in Canada’s prison system continues to expand.<!-- page 223 -->
In 1995–96, Aboriginal people made up 16% of all those sentenced to custody.<!-- page 223 -->
By 2011–12, that number had grown to 28% of all admissions to sentenced custody, even though Aboriginal people make up only 4% of the Canadian adult population.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^129</a><!-- page 223 -->
The situation of women is even more disproportionate: in 2011–12, 43% of admissions of women to sentenced custody were Aboriginal.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^130</a><!-- page 223 --></p>
<p>The causes of the over-incarceration of Aboriginal people are complex.<!-- page 223 -->
The convictions of Aboriginal offenders frequently result from an interplay of factors, including the intergenerational legacy of residential schools.<!-- page 223 -->
Aboriginal overrepresentation in prison reflects a systemic bias in the Canadian justice system.<!-- page 223 -->
Once Aboriginal persons are arrested, prosecuted, and convicted, they are more likely to be sentenced to prison than non-Aboriginal people.<!-- page 223 -->
In 2011–12, Aboriginal people made up 21% of those who received probation or conditional sentences (under which a defendant is found guilty but allowed to remain in the community).<a href="footnote-placeholder">^131</a><!-- page 223 --></p>
<p>Parliament has recently passed legislation to prescribe mandatory minimum sentences of imprisonment for certain offences.<!-- page 223 -->
Judges are required to impose these mandatory minimums.<!-- page 223 -->
Additional restrictions have also been placed on community sanctions.<!-- page 223 -->
These decisions have further contributed to the over-incarceration of Aboriginal people in prison.<!-- page 223 -->
It is assumed that locking up offenders makes communities safer, but there is no evidence to demonstrate that this is indeed the case.<!-- page 223 -->
There are concerns that Aboriginal people are not receiving culturally appropriate rehabilitative programs in federal prisons, and they are even less likely to have access to such programs in provincial correctional institutions for those people serving sentences of less than two years.<!-- page 223 --></p>
<p>Violence and criminal offending are not inherent in Aboriginal people.<!-- page 223 -->
They result from very specific experiences that Aboriginal people have endured, including the intergenerational legacy of residential schools.<!-- page 223 --><!-- page 224 -->
It should not be surprising that those who experienced and witnessed very serious violence against Aboriginal children in the schools frequently became accustomed to violence in later life.<!-- page 224 -->
One intergenerational Survivor recalled that her mother<!-- page 224 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>never talked about it very much or never expressed it.<!-- page 224 -->
And she was very quiet, and she had issues with alcohol, and I saw that, and that was basically the only time that she was really aggressive I guess is during those times when she drank….<!-- page 224 -->
And my father was also very aggressive.<!-- page 224 -->
It was a very violent home actually.<!-- page 224 -->
My brothers used to fight each other, and my brothers would fight my dad, and my mom and my dad would fight, and a lot of violence in the home, actually to the point where my brother, my oldest brother, killed my, one of our other brothers in the home …<!-- page 224 -->
when I was nine, and I saw the whole thing.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^132</a><!-- page 224 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Commission heard numerous accounts of the hardships experienced by former residential school students who became involved with the justice system.<!-- page 224 -->
For many, there were painful parallels between their time in school and their time in jail.<!-- page 224 -->
For Daniel Andre, the road from Grollier Hall in Inuvik in the Northwest Territories led, inevitably, to jail.<!-- page 224 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I knew that I needed help to get rid of what happened to me in residential school.<!-- page 224 -->
Like, everywhere I went, everything I did, all the jobs I had, all the towns I lived in, all the people I met, always brought me back to, to being in residential school, and being humiliated, and beaten, and ridiculed, and told I was a piece of garbage, I was not good enough, I was, like, a dog…<!-- page 224 -->
So, one of the scariest things for me being in jail is being humiliated in front of everybody, being made, laughed at, and which they do often ’cause they’re just, like, that’s just the way they are.<!-- page 224 -->
And a lot of them are, like, survival of the fittest.<!-- page 224 -->
And, like, if you show weakness, they’ll, they’ll just pick on you even more and …<!-- page 224 -->
I had to, to survive.<!-- page 224 -->
I had to be strong enough to survive.<!-- page 224 -->
I had to, I had to build up a system where I became a jerk.<!-- page 224 -->
I became a bad person.<!-- page 224 -->
I became an asshole.<!-- page 224 -->
But I survived, and learnt all those things to survive.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^133</a><!-- page 224 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It should not be surprising that those who were sexually abused in the schools as children sometimes perpetuated sexual violence later in their lives.<!-- page 224 -->
It should not be surprising that those who were taken from their parents and exposed to harsh and regimented discipline in the schools and disparagement of their culture and families often became poor and sometimes violent parents later in their lives.<!-- page 224 -->
It should not be surprising that those who were exposed to poor education and to spiritual and cultural abuse in the schools later turned to alcohol and drugs as a means to cope and try to forget.<!-- page 224 -->
The consequences for many students and their families were tragic.<!-- page 224 --></p>

<p>In 1996, Parliament legislated principles that would allow offenders who might otherwise be imprisoned to serve their sentences in the community.<!-- page 225 -->
A centrepiece of these reforms was Section 718.2(e) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>, which instructs judges that “all available sanctions other than imprisonment that are reasonable in the circumstances should be considered for all offenders, with particular attention to the circumstances of aboriginal offenders.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^135</a><!-- page 225 --></p>
<p>In 1999, in <em>R. v. Gladue</em>, the Supreme Court stated that Section 718.2(e) of the <em>Criminal Code</em> was enacted in response to alarming evidence that Aboriginal peoples were incarcerated disproportionately to non-Aboriginal people in Canada.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^136</a><!-- page 225 -->
The court stressed that this section is a remedial provision, enacted specifically to oblige the judiciary to make special efforts to find reasonable alternatives to imprisonment for Aboriginal offenders and to take into account the background and systemic factors that bring Aboriginal people into contact with the justice system.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^137</a><!-- page 225 --></p>
<p>In some jurisdictions, the <em>Gladue</em> decision has resulted in the production of more extensive pre-sentence, or “Gladue,” reports that detail the background and contextual circumstances of Aboriginal offenders.<!-- page 225 -->
These reports help inform judges’ sentencing decisions and are meant to encourage alternative options to incarceration.<!-- page 225 -->
However, bringing these reports to court has not been without difficulty and controversy.<!-- page 225 -->
Some jurisdictions provide few resources for the intensive, specialized, and culturally sensitive work that is necessary to produce an adequate Gladue report, despite the clear mandate given by the Supreme Court.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^138</a><!-- page 225 --></p>
<p>In 2012, the Supreme Court revisited and reaffirmed Gladue.<!-- page 225 -->
In <em>R. v. Ipeelee</em>, the Supreme Court pointed out that some judges had erred in their application of Gladue by concluding that it did not apply to serious offences or that it required an offender to demonstrate a causal connection between the commission of the crime and the legacy of residential schools or other background or contextual factors that help explain why an Aboriginal offender is before the courts.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^139</a><!-- page 225 --><!-- page 226 --></p>
<p>Even if excellent Gladue reports were prepared from coast to coast, they would still fail to make a difference in the amount of Aboriginal overrepresentation in the prison system without the addition of realistic alternatives to imprisonment, including adequate resources for intensive community programs that can respond to the conditions that caused Aboriginal offending.<!-- page 226 --></p>

<p>A failure to provide sufficient and stable resources for the community and treatment programs that are necessary to implement Gladue and Ipeelee helps explain why those decisions have not slowed increasing Aboriginal overrepresentation in prison.<!-- page 226 -->
In addition to these significant challenges, there are now new barriers to implementing effective and just alternative sentences for Aboriginal offenders.<!-- page 226 --></p>
</section></section><section class="section3" id="mandatory-minimum-sentences"><h3><a class="toclink" href="#mandatory-minimum-sentences">Mandatory minimum sentences<!-- page 226 --></a></h3>
<p>One of the most dramatic examples of the trend towards mandatory minimum sentence is the Safe Streets and Communities Act (Bill C-10), which came into force in 2012.<!-- page 226 -->
The Act specifies minimum sentences that judges must impose for certain crimes.<!-- page 226 -->
As a result of the new legislation, certain offences are no longer eligible for a conditional sentence.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^140</a><!-- page 226 --></p>
<p>Bill C-10 and other similar <em>Criminal Code</em> amendments have undermined the 1996 reforms that required judges to consider all reasonable alternatives to imprisonment, with particular attention to the circumstances of Aboriginal offenders.<!-- page 226 -->
The Commission believes that the recent introduction of mandatory minimum sentences and restrictions on conditional sentences will increase Aboriginal overrepresentation in prison.<!-- page 226 -->
Such developments are preventing judges from implementing community sanctions even when they are consistent with the safety of the community and even when they have a much greater potential than imprisonment to respond to the intergenerational legacy of residential schools that often results in offences by Aboriginal persons.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^141</a><!-- page 226 --></p>

<p>There is another link between the substance abuse that has plagued many residential school Survivors and the over-incarceration of Aboriginal people.<!-- page 227 -->
Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is a permanent brain injury caused when a woman’s consumption of alcohol during pregnancy affects her fetus.<!-- page 227 -->
The disabilities associated with FASD include memory impairments, problems with judgment and abstract reasoning, and poor adaptive functioning.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^142</a><!-- page 227 -->
It is a debilitating cognitive impairment, which children must live with for the rest of their lives, through no fault of their own.<!-- page 227 -->
A study done for the Aboriginal Healing Foundation drew links among the intergenerational trauma of residential schools, alcohol addictions, and FASD.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^143</a><!-- page 227 -->
The study concluded that the “residential school system contributed to the central risk factor involved, substance abuse, but also to factors shown to be linked to alcohol abuse, such as child and adult physical, emotional and sexual abuse, mental health problems and family dysfunction.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^144</a><!-- page 227 --></p>
<p>About 1% of Canadian children are born with some form of disability related to prenatal alcohol consumption, but estimates from Canada and the United States suggest that 15% to 20% of prisoners have FASD.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^145</a><!-- page 227 -->
A recent Canadian study found that offenders with FASD had much higher rates of criminal involvement than those without FASD, including more juvenile and adult convictions.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^146</a><!-- page 227 -->
The Commission believes there is a need to take urgent measures both to prevent FASD and to better manage its harmful consequences.<!-- page 227 -->
There is a clear need in Aboriginal communities for more programming that addresses the problems of addiction and FASD.<!-- page 227 --></p>

<li>We call upon the federal, provincial, and territorial governments to recognize as a high priority the need to address and prevent Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD), and to develop, in collaboration with Aboriginal people, FASD preventive programs that can be delivered in a culturally appropriate manner.<!-- page 227 --></li>
</ol>
<p>It is challenging for courts to deal with offenders with FASD, because obtaining an official diagnosis entails a long and costly process of multidisciplinary referrals.<!-- page 227 -->
Even if trial judges have been educated about the symptoms of FASD, they are generally unable to take notice of FASD without evidence of a diagnosis.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^147</a><!-- page 227 -->
Clearly, better diagnostic tools are needed, accompanied by sufficient resources for intensive community programs as realistic alternatives to jail and as support for people living with FASD to avoid repeated conflicts with the law.<!-- page 227 --><!-- page 228 --></p>
<p>The recent enactment of mandatory minimum sentences for some offences further complicates the situation of offenders with FASD because it denies judges the flexibility to consider individual circumstances in their sentencing.<!-- page 228 -->
There is a danger that prison will be used unnecessarily as another expensive crisis intervention for Aboriginal offenders with FASD, even though culturally appropriate supports in the community could often be a more appropriate approach.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^148</a><!-- page 228 -->
As well as amending mandatory minimum sentencing laws, the federal government can do much more to tailor correctional and parole resources to facilitate the reintegration of offenders with FASD into their communities.<!-- page 228 --></p>

<p>Studies based on interviews with Aboriginal inmates have confirmed that Aboriginal culture and spirituality can contribute to the healing of the inmates, to increased self-esteem, and to positive changes in lifestyle that make release and reintegration a real possibility.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^149</a><!-- page 228 -->
Research suggests that recidivism rates for Aboriginal offenders who had participated in spiritual activities (such as sweat lodge ceremonies) were lower than for those who had not.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^150</a><!-- page 228 --></p>
<p>However, Aboriginal people receive few services in provincial correctional facilities that are designed for those serving sentences of two years less a day or are awaiting trial.<!-- page 228 -->
Only a few provinces, such as British Columbia, have Aboriginal justice strategies that include cultural awareness training for officials and contracting with Aboriginal communities to provide spiritual leadership, counselling, and cultural programming for prisoners.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^151</a><!-- page 228 --><!-- page 229 --></p>
<p>The need for cultural programs in jail was expressed by a former residential school student who was an inmate at a correctional facility in Yellowknife.<!-- page 229 -->
The Survivor told the Commission, “It would be nice if our own people would come in here and teach us about life …<!-- page 229 -->
you know, how to live.<!-- page 229 -->
This is not the way of life for us.<!-- page 229 -->
It’s not the way for us people.<!-- page 229 -->
But if they would teach a program like that, that will catch somebody for sure.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^152</a><!-- page 229 --></p>
<p>There are some federal programs that appear to be working, but Aboriginal inmates do not have access to these programs in all parts of the country.<!-- page 229 -->
For example, although Aboriginal healing lodges within correctional facilities have great potential to assist Aboriginal inmates, there are only four such lodges run by Correctional Services Canada and four run by Aboriginal communities under Section 81 of the Corrections and Conditional Release Act.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^153</a><!-- page 229 -->
Lack of funding and difficulties in recruiting and training staff are obstacles to successful expansion of the healing lodge resources.<!-- page 229 -->
In addition, prisoners must be classified as “minimum security” to be eligible, and 90% of Aboriginal inmates are assigned “medium” or “maximum” security classifications.<!-- page 229 --></p>

<p>Aboriginal offenders face many challenges in obtaining parole from prison and beginning their transition back into the community.<!-- page 229 -->
For many Aboriginal inmates seeking parole, their criminal history is a major factor held against them.<!-- page 229 -->
Although some research has concluded that criminal history is a reliable risk predictor for both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal inmates, systemic discrimination related to poverty and the legacy of residential schools undoubtedly disadvantages Aboriginal offenders.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^154</a><!-- page 229 -->
Just as some courts have the benefit of background and contextual information contained in pre-sentencing reports, parole hearings need a full understanding of an offender’s circumstances when making their decisions.<!-- page 229 --></p>
<p>When the National Parole Board grants parole, correctional programming continues.<!-- page 230 -->
The early stages of parole are often spent in a residential correctional facility: a halfway house.<!-- page 230 -->
Although it is not a prison, a halfway house requires the offender to reside there and not be absent except under specific exceptions (for example, supervised absences or employment).<!-- page 230 -->
It is intended as a transitional phase in an offender’s parole, neither full incarceration nor full freedom in the community, with the goal of gradual reintegration into the community.<!-- page 230 -->
Unfortunately, there are too few halfway houses that provide programming specifically for Aboriginal offenders.<!-- page 230 --></p>

<p>The youth justice system, perhaps even more than the adult criminal justice system, is failing Aboriginal families.<!-- page 230 -->
Aboriginal girls make up 49% of the youth admitted to custody, and Aboriginal boys are 36% of those admitted to custody.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^155</a><!-- page 230 -->
The current law regarding young people accused of crimes is the <em>Youth Criminal Justice Act</em>, which was introduced in 2002.<!-- page 230 -->
One of the key objectives of the Act is to reserve jail for the most violent or habitual offenders.<!-- page 230 -->
Even in such cases, one of the express goals of the youth criminal justice system is to address the circumstances underlying a young person’s offending behaviour in order to rehabilitate and reintegrate them.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^156</a><!-- page 230 -->
The Act has the flexibility to allow Aboriginal communities to have some measure of control over the youth process and to ensure Aboriginal perspectives are considered in individual cases.<!-- page 230 --></p>
<p>By many objective measures, the <em>Youth Criminal Justice Act</em> has been a success.<!-- page 230 -->
Since it came into effect, there has been a steady decline in youth crime, youth court caseloads, and youth supervised on community sentences and in custody.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^157</a><!-- page 230 -->
But one thing the Act has not succeeded in doing is reducing the overrepresentation of Aboriginal youth in the criminal justice system.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^158</a><!-- page 230 -->
The great vulnerability and disadvantage experienced by so many Aboriginal youth undoubtedly contribute to their overrepresentation, a factor that is intimately tied to the legacy of the residential schools.<!-- page 230 -->
Many of today’s Aboriginal children and youth live with the legacy of residential schools every day, as they struggle to deal with high rates of addictions, fetal alcohol disorder, mental health issues, family violence, incarceration of parents, and the intrusion of child-welfare authorities.<!-- page 230 -->
All these factors place them at greater risk of involvement with crime.<!-- page 230 --></p>
<p>The growing overrepresentation of Aboriginal youth in custody mirrors and is likely related to the even more dramatic overrepresentation of Aboriginal children in the care of child-welfare agencies.<!-- page 230 --><!-- page 231 -->
Research in British Columbia found that 35.5% of youth in care are also involved in the youth justice system, as compared with only 4.4% of youth who are not in care.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^159</a><!-- page 231 -->
The Commission believes that there are ways to reduce the growing overrepresentation of Aboriginal youth, but that they will be found primarily outside the justice system.<!-- page 231 -->
There is an urgent need to support Aboriginal families and alleviate the poverty experienced by many Aboriginal communities.<!-- page 231 -->
The federal government should take the lead by committing the resources necessary to eliminating the overrepresentation of Aboriginal children and youth in care and custody.<!-- page 231 -->
Part of that commitment should include collecting and publishing better data to measure progress.<!-- page 231 --></p>

<p>An astonishing number of Aboriginal children were victims of crime in residential schools.<!-- page 231 -->
By the end of 2014, the Independent Assessment Process had resolved 30,939 sexual or serious physical abuse claims, awarding $2.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^69</a><!-- page 231 -->
billion in compensation.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^160</a><!-- page 231 -->
Although not every case would have involved a criminal act, the vast majority did, easily allowing anyone to conclude that the Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement involved the largest single recognition of criminal victimization in Canadian history.<!-- page 231 -->
This victimization of children has carried profound and long-lasting effects.<!-- page 231 -->
Ruby Firth, a former student at Stringer Hall, told the Commission,<!-- page 231 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>All through my, residential school …<!-- page 231 -->
I was a victim.<!-- page 231 -->
They put me in that frame of mind where I was a victim.<!-- page 231 -->
I was four years old being a victim.<!-- page 231 -->
Five years old, couldn’t stop it.<!-- page 231 -->
Six years old, couldn’t stop it.<!-- page 231 -->
Seven years old, couldn’t stop it.<!-- page 231 -->
So at some point my brain is going to say, “This is never going to stop!”<!-- page 231 -->
So that’s what I was doing in my adult life too because it didn’t stop in my childhood, I was doing that in my adult, “This is never going to stop.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^161</a><!-- page 231 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The justice system continues to fail Aboriginal victims of crime.<!-- page 231 -->
There are few services available for Aboriginal victims of crime.<!-- page 231 -->
Victim compensation schemes are often lacking and often fail to recognize the distinct needs of Aboriginal victims of crime.<!-- page 231 --></p>
<p>The statistics are startling.<!-- page 231 -->
Aboriginal people are 58% more likely to be victimized by crime.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^162</a><!-- page 231 -->
Aboriginal women report being victimized by violent crime at a rate almost three times higher than non-Aboriginal women—13% of Aboriginal women reported being victimized by violent crime in 2009.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^163</a><!-- page 231 --><!-- page 232 -->
In the same year, one in ten Aboriginal people reported being a victim of a non-spousal violent crime, more than double the rate reported by non-Aboriginal people.<!-- page 232 --></p>
<p>It is difficult to obtain accurate information about the rate of victimization in Aboriginal communities.<!-- page 232 -->
According to some studies, less than one-third of victims of crime report their victimization to police, and police forces across the country do not have a consistent method for recording the Aboriginal identity of victims.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^164</a><!-- page 232 -->
Statistics Canada does not provide the kinds of supports necessary to permit some Aboriginal victims to comfortably disclose their experience to researchers.<!-- page 232 -->
The most recent Statistics Canada data on homicide and family violence fail to report how many victims were Aboriginal, although older data suggest the homicide victimization rate of Aboriginal people between 1997 and 2000 was seven times that of non-Aboriginal people.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^165</a><!-- page 232 --></p>

<p>The overrepresentation of Aboriginal women and girls among crime victims is particularly disturbing.<!-- page 232 -->
Aboriginal women and girls are more likely than other women to experience risk factors for violence.<!-- page 232 -->
They are disproportionately young, poor, unemployed, and likely to have been involved with the child-welfare system and to live in a community marked by social disorder.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^166</a><!-- page 232 --></p>
<p>Velma Jackson, who attended the Blue Quills residential school in Alberta, told the Commission her story.<!-- page 232 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A lot of other girls my age were [in Blue Quills], but I only know of one that survived, all the rest are dead today.<!-- page 233 -->
Some died on the street.<!-- page 233 -->

<p>The most disturbing aspect of this victimization is the extraordinary number of Aboriginal women who have been murdered or are reported as missing.<!-- page 233 -->
A report by the RCMP, released in 2014, found that between 1980 and 2012, 1,017 Aboriginal women and girls were killed and 164 were missing.<!-- page 233 -->
Two hundred and twenty-five of these cases remain unsolved.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^168</a><!-- page 233 --></p>
<p>More research is needed, but the available information suggests a devastating link between the large numbers of missing and murdered Aboriginal women and the many harmful background factors in their lives.<!-- page 233 -->
These include: overrepresentation of Aboriginal children in child-welfare care; domestic and sexual violence; racism, poverty, and poor educational and health opportunities in Aboriginal communities; discriminatory practices against women related to band membership and Indian status; and inadequate supports for Aboriginal people in cities.<!-- page 233 -->
This complex interplay of factors—many of which are part of the legacy of residential schools—needs to be examined, as does the lack of success of police forces in solving these crimes against Aboriginal women.<!-- page 233 --></p>

Compiling better data on Aboriginal overrepresentation in the justice system is a starting point.<!-- page 233 -->
Collection of this data must be coupled with developing measurable goals for reducing this overrepresentation and providing the resources necessary to reach those goals.<!-- page 233 -->
The approach must be an holistic and culturally appropriate one that addresses the need for improvements in health, education, and economic development in Aboriginal communities.<!-- page 233 --><!-- page 234 --></p>

These rights are grounded in international and constitutional law as well as in the Treaties.<!-- page 234 -->
Aboriginal forms of justice may be as diverse as Canada’s Aboriginal peoples themselves.<!-- page 234 -->
It is a central conclusion of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada that recognition of the Aboriginal right to self-determination, more appropriate funding allocations for services from governments, and methodical tracking of progress are the preconditions for redressing the disastrous legacy of residential schools and aiding the long process of reconciliation within Canada.<!-- page 234 --></p>

<p>Canada has a long history of colonialism in relation to Aboriginal peoples.<!-- page 243 -->
That history and its policies of cultural genocide and assimilation have left deep scars on the lives of many Aboriginal people, on Aboriginal communities, as well as on Canadian society, and have deeply damaged the relationship between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal peoples.<!-- page 243 -->
It took a long time for that damage to have been done and for the relationship we see to have been created, and it will take us a long time to fix it.<!-- page 243 -->
But the process has already begun.<!-- page 243 --></p>
<p>An important process of healing and reconciling that relationship began in the 1980s with church apologies for their treatment of Aboriginal peoples and disrespect of their cultures.<!-- page 243 -->
It continued with the findings of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples, along with court recognition of the validity of the Survivors’ stories.<!-- page 243 -->
It culminated in the Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement and the prime minister of Canada’s apology in Parliament in June 2008, along with the apologies of all other parliamentary leaders.<!-- page 243 -->
That process of healing and reconciliation must continue.<!-- page 243 -->
The ultimate objective must be to transform our country and restore mutual respect between peoples and nations.<!-- page 243 --></p>
<p>Reconciliation is in the best interests of all of Canada.<!-- page 243 -->
It is necessary not only to resolve the ongoing conflicts between Aboriginal peoples and institutions of the country, but also in order for Canada to remove a stain from its past and be able to maintain its claim to be a leader in the protection of human rights among the nations of the world.<!-- page 243 -->
Canada’s historical development, as well as the view held strongly by some that the history of that development is accurate and beneficent, raises significant barriers to reconciliation in the twenty-first century.<!-- page 243 --></p>
<p>No Canadian can take pride in this country’s treatment of Aboriginal peoples, and, for that reason, all Canadians have a critical role to play in advancing reconciliation in ways that honour and revitalize the nation-to-nation Treaty relationship.<!-- page 243 --></p>
<p>At the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada’s (TRC) Traditional Knowledge Keepers Forum held in June 2014, Chief Ian Campbell said, “Our history is your history, as Canada …<!-- page 243 -->
until Canada accepts that …<!-- page 243 -->
this society will never flourish to its full potential.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^1</a><!-- page 243 --></p>
<p>The history and destructive legacy of the residential school system is a powerful reminder that Canada disregarded its own historical roots.<!-- page 244 -->
Canada’s determination to assimilate Aboriginal peoples, in spite of the early relationship established at first contact and formalized and maintained in Treaties, attests to that fact.<!-- page 244 -->
As Gerry St. Germain (Métis), then a Canadian senator, said,<!-- page 244 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>There can be no doubt that the founders of Canada somehow lost their moral compass in their relations with the people who occupied and possessed the land…<!-- page 244 -->
While we cannot change history, we can learn from it and we can use it to shape our common future…<!-- page 244 -->
This effort is crucial in realizing the vision of creating a compassionate and humanitarian society, the society that our ancestors, the Aboriginal, the French and the English peoples, envisioned so many years ago—our home, Canada.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^2</a><!-- page 244 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Aboriginal peoples have always remembered the original relationship they had with early Canadians.<!-- page 244 -->
That relationship of mutual support, respect, and assistance was confirmed by the Royal Proclamation of 1763 and the Treaties with the Crown that were negotiated in good faith by their leaders.<!-- page 244 -->
That memory, confirmed by historical analysis and passed down through Indigenous oral histories, has sustained Aboriginal peoples in their long political struggle to live with dignity as self-determining peoples with their own cultures, laws, and connections to the land.<!-- page 244 --></p>
<p>The destructive impacts of residential schools, the <em>Indian Act</em>, and the Crown’s failure to keep its Treaty promises have damaged the relationship between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal peoples.<!-- page 244 -->
The most significant damage is to the trust that has been broken between the Crown and Aboriginal peoples.<!-- page 244 -->
That broken trust must be repaired.<!-- page 244 -->
The vision that led to that breach in trust must be replaced with a new vision for Canada; one that fully embraces Aboriginal peoples’ right to self-determination within, and in partnership with, a viable Canadian sovereignty.<!-- page 244 -->
If Canadians fail to find that vision, then Canada will not resolve long-standing conflicts between the Crown and Aboriginal peoples over Treaty and Aboriginal rights, lands, and resources, or the education, health, and well-being of Aboriginal peoples.<!-- page 244 -->
Reconciliation will not be achieved, and neither will the hope for reconciliation be sustainable over time.<!-- page 244 -->
It would not be inconceivable that the unrest we see today among young Aboriginal people could grow to become a challenge to the country’s own sense of well-being and its very security.<!-- page 244 --></p>
<p>Reconciliation must become a way of life.<!-- page 244 -->
It will take many years to repair damaged trust and relationships in Aboriginal communities and between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal peoples.<!-- page 244 -->
Reconciliation not only requires apologies, reparations, the relearning of Canada’s national history, and public commemoration, but also needs real social, political, and economic change.<!-- page 244 -->
Ongoing public education and dialogue are essential to reconciliation.<!-- page 244 -->
Governments, churches, educational institutions, and Canadians from all walks of life are responsible for taking action on reconciliation in concrete ways, working collaboratively with Aboriginal peoples.<!-- page 244 -->
Reconciliation begins with each and every one of us.<!-- page 244 --></p>
<p>The Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal youth of our country have told the Commission that they want to know the truth about the history and legacy of residential schools.<!-- page 245 -->
They want to understand their responsibilities as parties to the same Treaties—in other words, as Treaty people.<!-- page 245 -->
They want to learn about the rich contributions that Aboriginal peoples have made to this country.<!-- page 245 -->
They understand that reconciliation involves a conversation not only about residential schools, but also about all other aspects of the relationship between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal peoples.<!-- page 245 --></p>
<p>As Commissioners, we believe that reconciliation is about respect.<!-- page 245 -->
That includes both self-respect for Aboriginal people and mutual respect among all Canadians.<!-- page 245 -->
All young people need to know who they are and from where they come.<!-- page 245 -->
Aboriginal children and youth, searching for their own identities and places of belonging, need to know and take pride in their Indigenous roots.<!-- page 245 -->
They need to know the answers to some very basic questions.<!-- page 245 -->
Who are my people?<!-- page 245 -->
What is our history?<!-- page 245 -->
How are we unique?<!-- page 245 -->
Where do I belong?<!-- page 245 -->
Where is my homeland?<!-- page 245 -->
What is my language and how does it connect me to my nation’s spiritual beliefs, cultural practices, and ways of being in the world?<!-- page 245 -->
They also need to know why things are the way they are today.<!-- page 245 -->
That requires an understanding of the history of colonization, including the residential school system and how it has affected their families, communities, their people, and themselves.<!-- page 245 --></p>
<p>Of equal importance, non-Aboriginal children and youth need to comprehend how their own identities and family histories have been shaped by a version of Canadian history that has marginalized Aboriginal peoples’ history and experience.<!-- page 245 -->
They need to know how notions of European superiority and Aboriginal inferiority have tainted mainstream society’s ideas about, and attitudes towards, Aboriginal peoples in ways that have been profoundly disrespectful and damaging.<!-- page 245 -->
They too need to understand Canada’s history as a settler society and how assimilation policies have affected Aboriginal peoples.<!-- page 245 -->
This knowledge and understanding will lay the groundwork for establishing mutually respectful relationships.<!-- page 245 --></p>

<p>In the summer of 1990, at Oka, Québec, the Mohawks of Kanesatake, the government of Québec, the Québec provincial police, and the Canadian military became embroiled in a violent confrontation over the town’s plan to develop a golf course on Mohawk burial grounds located in a forested area known as “The Pines.”<!-- page 245 -->
The Mohawks’ claim to that land and demands for the recognition of their traditional territory had gone unheeded for years by the federal government.<!-- page 245 -->
The resulting confrontation, according to historian J. R. Miller, was “proof of Canada’s failed Indian [land] claims policy.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^3</a><!-- page 245 -->
What had begun as a peaceful act of resistance by Mohawk people defending their lands took a violent turn.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^4</a><!-- page 245 -->
The “Oka crisis,” as it became widely known in the media, led to a seventy-eight-day standoff and involved armed resistance led by militarily trained Mohawk warriors.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^5</a><!-- page 245 --><!-- page 246 -->
It was an event that shook Canada’s complacency about Aboriginal demands to the core.<!-- page 246 -->
Shortly after an end to the siege had been negotiated, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney wrote:<!-- page 246 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The summer’s events must not be allowed to over-shadow the commitment that my government has made to addressing the concerns of aboriginal people…<!-- page 246 -->
These grievances raise issues that deeply affect all Canadians and therefore must be resolved by all Canadians working together…<!-- page 246 -->
The government’s agenda responds to the demands of aboriginal peoples and has four parts: resolving land claims; improving the economic and social conditions on reserves; defining a new relationship between aboriginal peoples and governments; and addressing the concerns of Canada’s aboriginal peoples in contemporary Canadian life.<!-- page 246 -->
Consultation with aboriginal peoples and respect for the fiduciary responsibilities of the Crown are integral parts of the process.<!-- page 246 -->
The federal government is determined to create a new relationship among aboriginal and non-aboriginal Canadians based on dignity, trust and respect.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^6</a><!-- page 246 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Government of Canada subsequently created a Royal Commission to look into the state of affairs of Aboriginal peoples in Canada.<!-- page 246 -->
The Royal Commission provided a glimpse into just how bad things had become.<!-- page 246 --></p>
<p>In 1996, the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples (RCAP) put forward a bold and comprehensive vision of reconciliation.<!-- page 246 -->
The RCAP report observed that if Canada was to thrive in the future, the relationship between Aboriginal peoples and the Crown must be transformed.<!-- page 246 -->
The report concluded that the policy of assimilation was a complete failure and that Canada must look to the historical Treaty relationship to establish a new relationship between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal peoples, based on the principles of mutual recognition, mutual respect, sharing, and mutual responsibility.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^7</a><!-- page 246 --></p>
<p>The Royal Commission emphasized that Aboriginal peoples’ right to self-determination is essential to a robust upholding of Canada’s constitutional obligations to Aboriginal peoples and compliance with international human rights law.<!-- page 246 -->
In other words, the RCAP report saw reconciliation as placing a heavy onus on the Government of Canada to change its conduct and to see the validity of the Aboriginal perspective of how the relationship should be in the future.<!-- page 246 --></p>
<p>In the years following the release of the RCAP report, developing a national vision of reconciliation has proved to be challenging.<!-- page 246 -->
In principle, Aboriginal peoples, governments, and the courts agree that reconciliation is needed.<!-- page 246 -->
In practice, it has been difficult to create the conditions for reconciliation to flourish.<!-- page 246 --></p>
<p>The Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement, including the creation of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada, was an attempt to resolve the thousands of lawsuits brought against the government for cases of historical abuse.<!-- page 246 -->
Its implementation has also been challenging.<!-- page 246 -->
Canada and the churches have made apologies to Survivors, their families, and communities.<!-- page 246 -->
Yet, Canadian government actions continue to be unilateral and divisive, and Aboriginal peoples continue to resist such actions.<!-- page 246 --><!-- page 247 -->
Negotiations on Treaties and land-claims agreements continue with a view to reconciling Aboriginal title and rights with Crown sovereignty.<!-- page 247 -->
However, many cases remain unresolved.<!-- page 247 -->
The courts have produced a body of law on reconciliation in relation to Aboriginal rights, which has established some parameters for discussion and negotiations, but there remains no ongoing national process or entity to guide that discussion.<!-- page 247 -->
What is clear to this Commission is that Aboriginal peoples and the Crown have very different and conflicting views on what reconciliation is and how it is best achieved.<!-- page 247 -->
The Government of Canada appears to believe that reconciliation entails Aboriginal peoples’ acceptance of the reality and validity of Crown sovereignty and parliamentary supremacy, in order to allow the government to get on with business.<!-- page 247 -->
Aboriginal people, on the other hand, see reconciliation as an opportunity to affirm their own sovereignty and return to the ‘partnership’ ambitions they held after Confederation.<!-- page 247 --></p>
</section><section class="section3" id="the-united-nations-declaration-on-the-rights-of-indigenous-peoples-as-a-framework-for-reconciliation"><h3><a class="toclink" href="#the-united-nations-declaration-on-the-rights-of-indigenous-peoples-as-a-framework-for-reconciliation">The <em>United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples</em> as a framework for reconciliation<!-- page 247 --></a></h3>
<p>Aboriginal peoples in Canada were not alone in the world when it came to being treated harshly by colonial authorities and settler governments.<!-- page 247 -->
Historical abuses of Aboriginal peoples and the taking of Indigenous lands and resources throughout the world have been the subject of United Nations’ attention for many years.<!-- page 247 -->
On September 13, 2007, after almost twenty-five years of debate and study, the United Nations (UN) adopted the <em>Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples</em>.<!-- page 247 -->
As a declaration, it calls upon member states to adopt and maintain its provisions as a set of “minimum standards for the survival, dignity and well-being of the indigenous peoples of the world.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^8</a><!-- page 247 --></p>
<p>The Commission concurs with the view of S.<!-- page 247 -->
James Anaya, UN Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, who observed,<!-- page 247 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is perhaps best to understand the Declaration and the right of self-determination it affirms as instruments of reconciliation.<!-- page 247 -->
Properly understood, self-determination is an animating force for efforts toward reconciliation—or, perhaps, more accurately, conciliation—with peoples that have suffered oppression at the hands of others.<!-- page 247 -->
Self-determination requires confronting and reversing the legacies of empire, discrimination, and cultural suffocation.<!-- page 247 -->
It does not do so to condone vengefulness or spite for past evils, or to foster divisiveness but rather to build a social and political order based on relations of mutual understanding and respect.<!-- page 247 -->
That is what the right of self-determination of indigenous peoples, and all other peoples, is about.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^9</a><!-- page 247 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Canada, as a member of the United Nations, initially refused to adopt the Declaration.<!-- page 247 -->
It joined the United States, Australia, and New Zealand in doing so.<!-- page 247 -->
It is not coincidence that all these nations have a common history as part of the British Empire.<!-- page 247 -->
The historical treatment of Aboriginal peoples in these other countries has strong parallels to what happened to Aboriginal peoples in Canada.<!-- page 247 --><!-- page 248 -->
Specifically, Canada objected to the Declaration’s<!-- page 248 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>provisions dealing with lands, territories and resources; free, prior and informed consent when used as a veto; self-government without recognition of the importance of negotiations; intellectual property; military issues; and the need to achieve an appropriate balance between the rights and obligations of Indigenous peoples, member States and third parties.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^10</a><!-- page 248 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although these four countries eventually endorsed the Declaration, they have all done so conditionally.<!-- page 248 -->
In 2010, Canada endorsed the Declaration as a “non-legally binding aspirational document.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^11</a><!-- page 248 -->
Despite this endorsement, we believe that the provisions and the vision of the Declaration do not currently enjoy government acceptance.<!-- page 248 -->
However, because Canada has accepted the Declaration, we hold the federal government to its word that it will genuinely aspire to achieve its provisions.<!-- page 248 --></p>
<p>In 2011, Canadian churches and social justice advocacy groups who had campaigned for Canada’s adoption of the Declaration urged the federal government to implement it.<!-- page 248 -->
However, Canada’s interpretation of the Declaration remained unchanged.<!-- page 248 -->
On September 22, 2014, at the World Conference on Indigenous Peoples (wcip) in New York, the United Nations General Assembly adopted an action-oriented “Outcome Document” to guide the implementation of the Declaration.<!-- page 248 -->
Member states from around the world committed, among other things, to the following:<!-- page 248 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Taking, in consultation and cooperation with indigenous peoples, appropriate measures at the national level, including legislative, policy, and administrative measures, to achieve the ends of the Declaration, and to promote awareness of it among all sectors of society, including members of legislatures, the judiciary and the civil service…<!-- page 248 -->
[para. 7] We commit ourselves to cooperating with indigenous peoples, through their own representative institutions, to develop and implement national action plans, strategies or other measures, where relevant, to achieve the ends of the Declaration [para. 8] …<!-- page 248 -->
[and also] encourage the private sector, civil society and academic institutions to take an active role in promoting and protecting the rights of indigenous peoples.<!-- page 248 -->
[para. 30]12<!-- page 248 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The “Outcome Document” represented an important step forward with regard to implementing the <em>Declaration</em> in practical terms.<!-- page 248 -->
The development of national action plans, strategies, and other concrete measures will provide the necessary structural and institutional frameworks for ensuring that Indigenous peoples’ right to self-determination is realized across the globe.<!-- page 248 --></p>
<p>Canada issued a formal statement at the wcip, objecting to certain paragraphs of the document related to the principle of obtaining the “free, prior and informed consent” (fpic) of Indigenous peoples when states are making decisions that will affect their rights or interests, including economic development on their lands.<!-- page 248 -->
Canada said,<!-- page 248 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Free, prior and informed consent, as it is considered in paragraphs 3 and 20 of the wcip Outcome Document, could be interpreted as providing a veto to Aboriginal groups and in that regard, cannot be reconciled with Canadian law, as it exists…<!-- page 249 -->
Canada cannot support paragraph 4, in particular, given that Canadian law, recently reaffirmed in a Supreme Court of Canada decision, states the Crown may justify the infringement of an Aboriginal or Treaty right if it meets a stringent test to reconcile Aboriginal rights with a broader public interest.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^13</a><!-- page 249 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a public statement, Indigenous leaders and their supporters said that Canada’s concerns were unfounded, noting that<!-- page 249 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>the notion that the Declaration could be interpreted as conferring an absolute and unilateral veto power has been repeatedly raised by Canada as a justification for its continued opposition to the Declaration.<!-- page 249 -->
This claim, however, has no basis either in the UN Declaration or in the wider body of international law.<!-- page 249 -->
Like standards of accommodation and consent set out by the Supreme Court of Canada, fpic in international law is applied in proportion to the potential for harm to the rights of Indigenous peoples and to the strength of these rights.<!-- page 249 -->
The word “veto” does not appear in the UN Declaration…<!-- page 249 -->
Canada keeps insisting that Indigenous peoples don’t have a say in development on their lands.<!-- page 249 -->
This position is not consistent with the UN <em>Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples</em>, decisions by its own courts, or the goal of reconciliation.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^14</a><!-- page 249 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reflecting on the importance of the Declaration to First Nations, Inuit, and Métis peoples in Canada, Grand Chief Edward John, Hereditary Chief of the Tl’azt’en Nation in northern British Columbia, explained,<!-- page 249 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>We have struggled for generations for recognition of our rights.<!-- page 249 -->
We have fought for our survival, dignity and well-being, and the struggle continues.<!-- page 249 -->
Canada’s denial of First Nations’ land rights falls well short of the minimum standards affirmed by the Declaration and demonstrates a clear failure by Canada to implement its human rights obligations.<!-- page 249 -->
Prime Minister Harper’s apology for Canada’s role in the Indian Residential Schools acknowledged that the policy of assimilation was wrong and has no place in our country.<!-- page 249 -->
Yet Canada’s policy of denying Aboriginal title and rights is premised on the same attitude of assimilation.<!-- page 249 -->
It is time for this attitude and the policies that flow from it to be cast aside.<!-- page 249 -->
The Declaration calls for the development of new relationships based on recognition and respect for the inherent human rights of Indigenous peoples.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^15</a><!-- page 249 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The TRC considers “reconciliation” to be an ongoing process of establishing and maintaining respectful relationships at all levels of Canadian society.<!-- page 249 -->
The Commission therefore believes that the <em>United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples</em> is the appropriate framework for reconciliation in twenty-first-century Canada.<!-- page 249 -->
Studying the Declaration with a view to identifying its impacts on current government laws, policy, and behaviour would enable Canada to develop a holistic vision of reconciliation that embraces all aspects of the relationship between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Canadians, and to set the standard for international achievement in its circle of hesitating nations.<!-- page 249 --><!-- page 250 --></p>
<p>Aboriginal peoples’ right to self-determination must be integrated into Canada’s constitutional and legal framework and civic institutions, in a manner consistent with the principles, norms, and standards of the <em>Declaration</em>.<!-- page 250 -->
Aboriginal peoples in Canada have Aboriginal and Treaty rights.<!-- page 250 -->
They have the right to access and revitalize their own laws and governance systems within their own communities and in their dealings with governments.<!-- page 250 -->
They have a right to protect and revitalize their cultures, languages, and ways of life.<!-- page 250 -->
They have the right to reparations for historical harms.<!-- page 250 --></p>
<p>In 2014, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that the Tsilhqot’in peoples have Aboriginal title to their lands in northern British Columbia, and “ownership rights similar to those associated with fee simple, including: the right to decide how the land will be used; the right of enjoyment and occupancy of the land; the right to possess the land; the right to the economic benefits of the land; and the right to pro-actively use and manage the land.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^16</a><!-- page 250 -->
The court said, “Governments and individuals proposing to use or exploit land, whether before or after a declaration of Aboriginal title, can avoid a charge of infringement or failure to adequately consult by obtaining the consent of the interested Aboriginal group.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^17</a><!-- page 250 --></p>
<p>In the face of growing conflicts over lands, resources, and economic development, the scope of reconciliation must extend beyond residential schools to encompass all aspects of Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal relations and connections to the land.<!-- page 250 -->
Therefore, in our view, it is essential that all levels of government endorse and implement the <em>Declaration</em>.<!-- page 250 -->
The Commission urges the federal government to reverse its position and fully endorse the “Outcome Document.”<!-- page 250 -->
We believe that the federal government must develop a national action plan to implement the <em>Declaration</em>.<!-- page 250 -->
This would be consistent with the direction provided by the Supreme Court of Canada.<!-- page 250 -->
More importantly, it would be consistent with the achievement of reconciliation.<!-- page 250 --></p>

</section></section><section class="section3" id="doctrine-of-discovery"><h3><a class="toclink" href="#doctrine-of-discovery">Doctrine of Discovery<!-- page 251 --></a></h3>
<p>Earlier in this report, we recalled how European states relied on the Doctrine of Discovery and the concept of <em>terra nullius</em> (lands belonging to no one) to justify empire building and the colonization of Aboriginal peoples and their lands in North America and across the globe.<!-- page 251 -->
Far from being ancient history with no relevance for reconciliation today, the Doctrine of Discovery underlies the legal basis on which British Crown officials claimed sovereignty over Indigenous peoples and justified the extinguishment of their inherent rights to their territories, lands, and resources.<!-- page 251 --></p>
<p>Speaking at the Manitoba National Event in 2010, former day school student, political leader, and educator Sol Sanderson explained the importance of making the connection between the policies and practices of imperialism and colonization and the need for transformative change in Canadian society.<!-- page 251 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>What were the objectives of those empire policies?<!-- page 251 -->
Assimilation, integration, civilization, Christianization and liquidation.<!-- page 251 -->
Who did those policies target?<!-- page 251 -->
They targeted the destruction of our Indigenous families worldwide.<!-- page 251 -->
Why?<!-- page 251 -->
Because that was the foundation of our governing systems.<!-- page 251 -->
They were the foundations of our institutions, and of our societies of our nations.<!-- page 251 -->
Now those policies still form the basis of Canadian law today, not just in the <em>Indian Act</em> [that] outlawed our traditions, our customs, our practices, our values, our language, our culture, our forms of government, our jurisdiction…<!-- page 251 -->
They say we have constitutionally protected rights in the form of inherent rights, Aboriginal rights and Treaty rights, but we find ourselves in courts daily defending those rights against the colonial laws of the provinces and the federal government.<!-- page 251 -->
Now, we can’t allow that to continue.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^18</a><!-- page 251 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>From 2010 to 2014, the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues undertook a number of studies and reports on the Doctrine of Discovery.<!-- page 251 -->
During this same time period, the Settlement Agreement churches also began to examine the Christian thinking that had justified taking Indigenous lands and removing children from their families and communities.<!-- page 251 -->
Writing about the Roman Catholic foundations of Aboriginal land claims in Canada, historian Jennifer Reid explains why the Doctrine remains relevant today.<!-- page 251 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most non-Aboriginal Canadians are aware of the fact that Indigenous peoples commonly regard land rights as culturally and religiously significant.<!-- page 251 -->
Fewer nonnatives, I suspect, would consider their own connection with property in the same light, and fewer still would regard the legal foundation of all land rights in Canada as conspicuously theological.<!-- page 251 -->
In fact, however, it is.<!-- page 251 -->
The relationship between law and land in Canada can be traced to a set of fifteenth-century theological assumptions that have found their way into Canadian law…<!-- page 251 -->
The Doctrine of Discovery was the legal means by which Europeans claimed rights of sovereignty, property, and trade in regions they allegedly discovered during the age of expansion.<!-- page 251 -->
These claims were made without consultation or engagement of any sort with the resident populations in these territories—the people to whom, by any sensible account, the land actually belonged.<!-- page 251 --><!-- page 252 -->
The Doctrine of Discovery has been a critical component of historical relationships between Europeans, their descendants, and Indigenous peoples, and it underlies their legal relationships to this day, having smoothly and relatively uncritically transitioned from Roman Catholic to international law.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^19</a><!-- page 252 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In April 2010, the Permanent Observer Mission of the Holy See (the UN representative from the Roman Catholic Vatican) issued a statement regarding the Doctrine of Discovery at the ninth session of the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^20</a><!-- page 252 -->
The statement noted that earlier papal bulls regarding territorial expansion and the forced conversion of Indigenous peoples had subsequently been abrogated or annulled by the Roman Catholic Church.<!-- page 252 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Regarding the question of the doctrine of discovery and the role of the Papal Bull Inter Coetera, the Holy See notes that Inter Coetera, as a source of international law …<!-- page 252 -->
was first of all abrogated by the Treaty of Tordesilles in 1494, and that Circumstances have changed so much that to attribute any juridical value to such a document seems completely out of place…<!-- page 252 -->
In addition, it was also abrogated by other Papal Bulls, for example, Sublimis Deus in 1537, which states, “Indians and all other people who may later be discovered by Christians, are by no means to be deprived of their liberty or the possession of their property …<!-- page 252 -->
should the contrary happen, it shall be null and have no effect.”<!-- page 252 -->
This view was expanded upon and reinforced in Immensa Pastorum of [Pope] Benedict XIV of 20 December 1741 and a number of other Papal Encyclicals, statements and decrees.<!-- page 252 -->
If any doubt remains, it is abrogated by Canon 6 of the Code of Canon Law of 1983 which abrogates in general all preceding penal and disciplinary laws…<!-- page 252 -->
Therefore, for International Law and for the Catholic Church Law, the Bull Inter Coetera is a historic remnant with no juridical, moral or doctrinal value…<!-- page 252 -->
The fact that juridical systems may employ the “Doctrine of Discovery” as a juridical precedent is now therefore a characteristic of the laws of those states and is independent of the fact that for the Church the document has had no value for centuries.<!-- page 252 -->
The refutation of this doctrine is therefore now under the competence of national authorities, legislators, lawyers and legal historians.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^21</a><!-- page 252 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For many, that Catholic statement was inadequate.<!-- page 252 -->
The doctrine’s influence in Western law and its destructive consequences for Indigenous peoples have been well documented by scholars and other experts.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^22</a><!-- page 252 --></p>
<p>In 2014, the North American representative to the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, Grand Chief Edward John, tabled the “Study on the Impacts of the Doctrine of Discovery on Indigenous Peoples, Including Mechanisms, Processes, and Instruments of Redress.”<!-- page 252 -->
The study concluded:<!-- page 252 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>With regard to land dispossessions, forced conversions of non-Christians, the deprivation of liberty and the enslavement of indigenous peoples, the Holy See reported that an “abrogation process took place over the centuries” to invalidate such nefarious actions.<!-- page 252 -->
Such papal renunciations do not go far enough.<!-- page 252 -->
There is a pressing need to decolonize from the debilitating impacts and ongoing legacy of denial by states of indigenous peoples’ inherent sovereignty, laws, and title to the lands, territories, and resources.<!-- page 252 --><!-- page 253 -->
At the same time, there is a growing movement among faith-based bodies to repudiate the doctrine of discovery.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^23</a><!-- page 253 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 2010, the Anglican Church of Canada was the first of the Settlement Agreement churches in Canada to reject the Doctrine of Discovery and to ”review the Church’s policies and programs with a view to exposing the historical reality and impact of the Doctrine of Discovery and eliminating its presence in its contemporary policies, program, and structures.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^24</a><!-- page 253 -->
In 2013, the Anglican Church established a Commission on Discovery, Reconciliation, and Justice, which had three goals:<!-- page 253 --></p>
<ol>
<li>to examine the Anglican Church of Canada’s policies and practices and revise them as necessary to be consistent with its repudiation of the Doctrine of Discovery;<!-- page 253 --></li>
<li>to look into the question of “what is reconciliation”; and<!-- page 253 --></li>
<li>to review the church’s commitment to addressing long-standing injustices borne by Indigenous peoples in Canada.<!-- page 253 --></li>
</ol>
<p>The Commission on Discovery will table a final report to the Anglican General Synod in 2016.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^25</a><!-- page 253 --></p>
<p>In February 2012, the Executive Committee of the World Council of Churches (wcc) also repudiated the Doctrine of Discovery.<!-- page 253 -->
The wcc represents over 500 million Christians, in more than 110 countries, in 345 member churches, including three of the Settlement Agreement churches.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^26</a><!-- page 253 -->
The wcc statement denounced the Doctrine of Discovery and urged governments to “dismantle the legal structures and policies based on the Doctrine of Discovery …<!-- page 253 -->
[and to] ensure that they conform to the <em>United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples</em>.”<!-- page 253 -->
The statement expressed solidarity with Indigenous peoples and affirmed their rights of self-determination and self-governance.<!-- page 253 -->
The wcc also asked its member churches to support Indigenous self-determination in spiritual matters and education of all members of their churches.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^27</a><!-- page 253 --></p>
<p>The United Church of Canada responded to this call.<!-- page 253 -->
At its meeting in March 2012, the Executive of the General Council of the United Church “agreed unanimously to disown the Doctrine of Discovery, a historical concept which has been used to rationalize the enslavement and colonization of Indigenous peoples around the world.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^28</a><!-- page 253 --></p>
<p>At the eleventh session of the UN Permanent Forum in May 2012, kairos, an interchurch social justice advocacy organization, made a joint statement with the Assembly of First Nations, Chiefs of Ontario, Grand Council of the Crees (Eeyou Istchee), Amnesty International, and the Canadian Friends Service Committee (Quakers) on the Doctrine of Discovery.<!-- page 253 -->
The statement said that “while churches have begun to repudiate this racist doctrine, States around the world have not.”<!-- page 253 -->
It recommended that states, in conjunction with Indigenous peoples, undertake legal and policy reform to remove “any remnants of doctrines of superiority, including ‘discovery,’ as a basis for the assumed sovereignty over Indigenous peoples and their lands and resources.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^29</a><!-- page 253 --><!-- page 254 --></p>
<p>In his report to the UN Permanent Forum, Grand Chief Edward John focused on how Canadian courts have dealt with sovereignty issues.<!-- page 254 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The highest court of Canada has recognized the need for reconciliation of “preexisting aboriginal sovereignty with assumed Crown sovereignty.”<!-- page 254 -->
The Supreme Court has taken judicial notice of “such matters as colonialism, displacement and residential schools,” which demonstrate how “assumed” sovereign powers were abused throughout history.<!-- page 254 -->
The root cause of such abuse leads back to the Doctrine of Discovery and other related fictitious constructs which must therefore be addressed.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^30</a><!-- page 254 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the thirteenth session of the UN Permanent Forum in May 2014, Haudenosaunee Faithkeeper Oren Lyons spoke about the principles of good governance as they relate to the <em>United Nations Declaration</em>.<!-- page 254 -->
He said,<!-- page 254 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>We recognize the Doctrine of Discovery and its long-term effects on our peoples led to the atrocities we faced in residential and boarding schools, both in Canada and the u.s…<!-- page 254 -->
the Doctrine of Discovery has been invoked as a justification for the ongoing exploitation of our lands, territories, and resources and directly violates Article 7 paragraph 2 of the undrip [the Declaration].<a href="footnote-placeholder">^31</a><!-- page 254 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Doctrine of Discovery and the related concept of terra nullius underpin the requirement for Aboriginal peoples to prove their pre-existing occupation of the land in court cases or to have their land and resource rights extinguished in contemporary Treaty and land-claims processes.<!-- page 254 -->
Such a requirement does not conform to international law or contribute to reconciliation.<!-- page 254 -->
Such concepts are a current manifestation of historical wrongs and should be formally repudiated by all levels of Canadian government.<!-- page 254 --></p>
<p>Our intention in so concluding is to highlight that there is an important distinction to be drawn between the Doctrine of Discovery and its related concepts and the several inherently unjust policies, laws, and principles to which they have given rise over the years.<!-- page 254 -->
It would not be enough to simply repudiate the Doctrine of Discovery, for example, while still maintaining the requirement for Aboriginal people to prove the validity of their existence and territoriality.<!-- page 254 -->
We would not suggest that the repudiation of the Doctrine of Discovery necessarily gives rise to the invalidation of Crown sovereignty.<!-- page 254 -->
The Commission accepts that there are other means to establish the validity of Crown sovereignty without undermining the important principle established in the Royal Proclamation of 1763, which is that the sovereignty of the Crown requires that it recognize and deal with Aboriginal title in order to become perfected.<!-- page 254 -->
It must not be forgotten that the terms of the Royal Proclamation were explained to, and accepted by, Indigenous leaders during the negotiation of the Treaty of Niagara of 1764.<!-- page 254 --></p>

<p>It is important for all Canadians to understand that without Treaties, Canada would have no legitimacy as a nation.<!-- page 255 -->
Treaties between Indigenous nations and the Crown established the legal and constitutional foundation of this country.<!-- page 255 --></p>
<p>Elder Fred Kelly emphasized that Treaty making and Aboriginal peoples’ ways of resolving conflict must be central to reconciliation.<!-- page 255 -->
He said,<!-- page 255 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are those who believe that a generic reconciliation process is a Westernbased concept to be imposed on the Aboriginal peoples without regard to their own traditional practices of restoring personal and collective peace and harmony.<!-- page 255 -->
We must therefore insist that the Aboriginal peoples have meaningful participation in the design, administration, and evaluation of the reconciliation process so that it is based on their local culture and language.<!-- page 255 -->
If reconciliation is to be real and meaningful in Canada, it must embrace the inherent right of self-determination through selfgovernment envisioned in the treaties…<!-- page 255 --></p>
<p>Where government refuses to implement Aboriginal rights and the original spirit and intent of the treaties, the citizens of Canada must take direct action to forcefully persuade its leadership.<!-- page 255 -->
Treaties and memoranda of agreement are simply the stage-setting mechanisms for reconciliation.<!-- page 255 -->
There must be action …<!-- page 255 -->
all Canadians have treaty rights…<!-- page 255 -->
It is upon these rights and obligations that our relationship is founded.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^32</a><!-- page 255 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If Canada’s past is a cautionary tale about what not to do, it also holds a more constructive history lesson for the future.<!-- page 255 -->
The Treaties are a model for how Canadians, as diverse peoples, can live respectfully and peacefully together on these lands we now share.<!-- page 255 --></p>
<section class="section3" id="the-royal-proclamation-of-1763-and-treaty-of-niagara-1764"><h3><a class="toclink" href="#the-royal-proclamation-of-1763-and-treaty-of-niagara-1764">The Royal Proclamation of 1763 and Treaty of Niagara, 1764<!-- page 255 --></a></h3>
<p>The history of Treaty making in Canada is contentious.<!-- page 255 -->
Aboriginal peoples and the Crown have interpreted the spirit and intent of the Treaties quite differently.<!-- page 255 -->
Generally, government officials have viewed the Treaties as legal mechanisms by which Aboriginal peoples ceded and surrendered their lands to the Crown.<!-- page 255 -->
In contrast, First Nations, Inuit, and Métis peoples understand Treaties as a sacred obligation that commits both parties to maintain respectful relationships and share lands and resources equitably.<!-- page 255 --></p>
<p>Indigenous peoples have kept the history and ongoing relevance of the Treaties alive in their own oral histories and legal traditions.<!-- page 255 -->
Without their perspectives on the history of Treaty making, Canadians know only one side of this country’s history.<!-- page 255 -->
This story cannot simply be told as the story of how Crown officials unilaterally imposed Treaties on Aboriginal peoples; they were also active participants in Treaty negotiations.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^33</a><!-- page 255 -->
The history and interpretation of Treaties and the Aboriginal–Crown relationship as told by Indigenous peoples enriches and informs our understanding of why we are all Treaty people.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^34</a><!-- page 255 --><!-- page 256 -->
This is evident, for example, in the story of the Royal Proclamation of 1763 and its relationship to the Treaty of Niagara of 1764.<!-- page 256 -->
The Royal Proclamation, which was issued by colonial officials, tells only half this story.<!-- page 256 --></p>
<p>On October 7, 1763, King George III issued a Royal Proclamation by which the British Crown first recognized the legal and constitutional rights of Aboriginal peoples in Canada.<!-- page 256 -->
In the Royal Proclamation of 1763, the British declared that all lands west of the established colonies belonged to Aboriginal peoples and that only the Crown could legally acquire these lands by negotiating Treaties.<!-- page 256 --></p>
<p>At a time when Aboriginal peoples still held considerable power and conflicts with settlers were increasing, British officials sought to establish a distinct geographical area that would remain under the jurisdiction of Indigenous nations until Treaties were negotiated.<!-- page 256 --></p>
<p>Anishinaabe legal scholar John Borrows notes that the Royal Proclamation can be fully understood only in relation to the Treaty of Niagara, in which the terms of the proclamation were ratified by Indigenous nations in 1764.<!-- page 256 -->
As Borrows explains, the Indigenous leaders who negotiated the Treaty of Niagara with the Crown did so with the understanding that they would remain free and self-determining peoples.<!-- page 256 -->
Borrows observes:<!-- page 256 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Proclamation uncomfortably straddled the contradictory aspirations of the Crown and First Nations when its wording recognized Aboriginal rights to land by outlining a policy that was designed to extinguish these rights…<!-- page 256 -->
The different objectives that First Nations and the Crown had in the formulation of the principles surrounding the Proclamation is the reason for the different visions embedded within its text.<!-- page 256 -->
Britain was attempting to secure territory and jurisdiction through the Proclamation, while the First Nations were concerned with preserving their lands and sovereignty.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^35</a><!-- page 256 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Royal Proclamation was ratified by over 2,000 Indigenous leaders who had gathered at Niagara in the summer of 1764 to make a Treaty with the Crown.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^36</a><!-- page 256 -->
The Treaty negotiations, like earlier trade and peace and friendship Treaties, were conducted in accordance with Indigenous law and diplomatic protocol.<!-- page 256 -->
John Borrows presents evidence that Aboriginal peoples, some fifty-four years after the Treaty of Niagara was negotiated and ratified, still remembered the promises that were made by the Crown.<!-- page 256 -->
In 1818, a Crown representative, Captain Thomas G.<!-- page 256 -->
Anderson, gave the following account of a meeting between Anishinaabe peoples and the Crown at Drummond Island in Lake Huron.<!-- page 256 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Chiefs did decamp, laying down a broad Wampum Belt, made in 1764…<!-- page 256 -->
Orcata [an Anishinaabe] speaker …<!-- page 256 -->
holding the Belt of 1764 in his hand …<!-- page 256 -->
said: Father, this my ancestors received from our Father, Sir. W. Johnson.<!-- page 256 -->
You sent word to all your red children to assemble at the crooked place (Niagara).<!-- page 256 -->
They heard your voice—obeyed the message—and the next summer met you at the place.<!-- page 256 -->
You then laid this belt on a mat, and said—‘Children, you must all touch this Belt of Peace.<!-- page 256 -->
I touch it myself, that we may all be brethren united, and hope our friendship will never cease.<!-- page 256 -->
I will call you my children; will send warmth (presents) to your country; and your families shall never be in want.<!-- page 256 --><!-- page 257 -->
Look towards the rising sun.<!-- page 257 -->
My Nation is as brilliant as it is, and its word cannot be violated.’ Father, your words were true—all you promised came to pass.<!-- page 257 -->
On giving us a Belt of Peace, you said—‘If you should ever require my assistance, send this Belt, and my hand will be immediately stretched forth to assist you.’ Here the speaker laid down the Belt.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^37</a><!-- page 257 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Over the years, Indigenous leaders involved in Treaty negotiations not only used wampum belts to recount the Treaty of Niagara, but also presented original copies of the Royal Proclamation to government officials.<!-- page 257 -->
In 1847, a colonial official reported,<!-- page 257 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The subsequent proclamation of His Majesty George Third, issued in 1763, furnished them with a fresh guarantee for the possession of their hunting grounds and the protection of the crown.<!-- page 257 -->
This document the Indians look upon as their charter.<!-- page 257 -->
They have preserved a copy of it to the present time, and have referred to it on several occasions in the representations to government.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^38</a><!-- page 257 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>On October 7, 2013, Canada marked the 250th anniversary of the Royal Proclamation of 1763.<!-- page 257 -->
The governor general of Canada, His Excellency the Right Honourable David Johnston, spoke about the proclamation’s importance.<!-- page 257 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This extraordinary document is part of the legal foundation of Canada.<!-- page 257 -->
It is enshrined in the Constitution Act of 1982, and it sets out a framework of values or principles that have given us a navigational map over the course of the past two-and-a-half centuries…<!-- page 257 -->
Its guiding principles—of peace, fairness and respect—established the tradition of treaty-making, laid the basis for the recognition of First Nations rights, and defined the relationship between First Nations peoples and the Crown…<!-- page 257 -->
All history reverberates through the ages, but the Royal Proclamation is uniquely alive in the present-day.<!-- page 257 -->
Not only is it a living constitutional document, its principles are of great relevance to our situation today, in 2013, and to our shared future…<!-- page 257 -->
Without a doubt, we have faced, and are facing challenges, and we have much hard work to do on the road to reconciliation, but it is a road we must travel together.<!-- page 257 -->
In modern time, the successful conclusion of comprehensive land claims agreements are an example of the principles of the Royal Proclamation in action.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^39</a><!-- page 257 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Across the country, Indigenous peoples also commemorated the anniversary, calling on Canadians to honour the spirit and intent of the Royal Proclamation.<!-- page 257 -->
In British Columbia, where very few Treaties were signed, the First Nations Summit leaders issued a statement reminding Canadians that the principles set out in the proclamation were still relevant in present-day Canada.<!-- page 257 -->
They said,<!-- page 257 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>With Confederation, the First Nations–Crown relationship has regrettably been guided by federal control under the constraints of the <em>Indian Act</em>, not by the principles articulated in the Proclamation…<!-- page 257 -->
The time has arrived for all Canadians to move into an era of recognition and reconciliation between First Nations and the Crown.<!-- page 257 -->
Although there is general recognition of Aboriginal title and rights, far too often these rights exist without an effective remedy.<!-- page 257 --><!-- page 258 -->
There are many solutions that have the potential of moving us to where we need to be.<!-- page 258 -->
Such solutions include the negotiation of modern-day treaties, agreements and other constructive arrangements, consistent with the principles of the Proclamation.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^40</a><!-- page 258 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Across the river from the parliament buildings in Ottawa that October, Idle No More supporters gathered in Gatineau, Québec, at the Canadian Museum of Civilization, to commemorate the Royal Proclamation as part of a national and international day of action.<!-- page 258 -->
One of the organizers, Clayton Thomas-Muller, said, “We are using this founding document of this country and its anniversary to usher in a new era of reconciliation of Canada’s shameful colonial history, to turn around centuries of neglect and abuse of our sacred and diverse nations.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^41</a><!-- page 258 --></p>
<p>In Toronto, the focus was on the Gus-Wen-Tah, or Two-Row Wampum Treaty belt, used by the Mohawk in Treaty negotiations with colonial European officials.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^42</a><!-- page 258 -->
As Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people gathered to mark the historic day, speaker Davyn Calfchild said, “Everyone needs to learn about the Two-Row and the nation-to-nation relationships it represents.<!-- page 258 -->
It’s not just for Native people; it’s for non-Native people too.”<!-- page 258 -->
The gathering ended with a march as people carried a replica of the Two-Row Wampum through the streets of the city.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^43</a><!-- page 258 -->
Those who commemorated the Royal Proclamation and the Two-Row Wampum emphasized that the principles and practices that cemented the Treaty relationship remain applicable today.<!-- page 258 --></p>
<p>The Royal Proclamation of 1763, in conjunction with the Treaty of Niagara of 1764, established the legal and political foundation of Canada and the principles of Treaty making based on mutual recognition and respect.<!-- page 258 -->
A Royal Proclamation is also an important symbol.<!-- page 258 -->
Issued at the highest level, it sends a message to all citizens about the values and principles that define the country.<!-- page 258 -->
There is a need for a new proclamation that reaffirms the long-standing, but often disregarded, commitments between Canada and Aboriginal peoples.<!-- page 258 -->
The proclamation would include an official disavowal of the Doctrine of Discovery and commitment to the full implementation of the <em>United Nations Declaration</em>.<!-- page 258 --></p>

<p>Until recently, Canadian law was used by Canada to suppress truth and deter reconciliation.<!-- page 261 -->
Parliament’s creation of assimilative laws and regulations facilitated the oppression of Aboriginal cultures and enabled the residential school system.<!-- page 261 -->
In addition, Canada’s laws and associated legal principles fostered an atmosphere of secrecy and concealment.<!-- page 261 -->
When children were abused in residential schools, the law, and the ways in which it was enforced (or not), became a shield behind which churches, governments, and individuals could hide to avoid the consequences of horrific truths.<!-- page 261 -->
Decisions not to charge or prosecute abusers allowed people to escape the harmful consequences of their actions.<!-- page 261 -->
In addition, the right of Aboriginal communities and leaders to function in accordance with their own customs, traditions, laws, and cultures was taken away by law.<!-- page 261 -->
Those who continued to act in accordance with those cultures could be, and were, prosecuted.<!-- page 261 -->
Aboriginal people came to see law as a tool of government oppression.<!-- page 261 --></p>
<p>To this point, the country’s civil laws continued to overlook the truth that the extinguishment of peoples’ languages and cultures is a personal and social injury of the deepest kind.<!-- page 261 -->
It is difficult to understand why the forced assimilation of children through removal from their families and communities—to be placed with people of another race for the purpose of destroying the race and culture from which the children come—can be deemed an act of genocide under Article 2(e) of the UN’s Convention on Genocide, but is not a civil wrong.<!-- page 261 --></p>
<p>Failure to recognize such truths hinders reconciliation.<!-- page 261 -->
Many Aboriginal people have a deep and abiding distrust of Canada’s political and legal systems because of the damage they have caused.<!-- page 261 -->
They often see Canada’s legal system as being an arm of a Canadian governing structure that has been diametrically opposed to their interests.<!-- page 261 -->
Not only has Canadian law generally not protected Aboriginal land rights, resources, and governmental authority, despite court judgments, but it has also allowed, and continues to allow, the removal of Aboriginal children through a child-welfare system that cuts them off from their culture.<!-- page 261 -->
As a result, law has been, and continues to be, a significant obstacle to reconciliation.<!-- page 261 -->
This is the case despite the recognition that courts have begun to show that justice has historically been denied and that such denial should not continue.<!-- page 261 -->
Given these circumstances, it should come as no surprise that formal Canadian law and Canada’s legal institutions are still viewed with suspicion within many Aboriginal communities.<!-- page 261 --></p>
<p>Yet, that is changing.<!-- page 261 -->
Court decisions since the repatriation of Canada’s Constitution in 1982 have given hope to Aboriginal people that the recognition and affirmation of their existing Treaty and Aboriginal rights in Section 35 of the <em>Constitution Act, 1982</em> may be an important vehicle for change.<!-- page 261 -->
However, the view of many Aboriginal people is that the utilization of the Government of Canada’s court is fraught with danger.<!-- page 261 -->
Aboriginal leaders and communities turn to Canada’s courts literally because there is no other legal mechanism.<!-- page 261 --></p>
<p>When they do so, it is with the knowledge that the courts still are reluctant to recognize their own traditional means of dispute resolution and law.<!-- page 262 --></p>
<p>Reconciliation will be difficult to achieve until Indigenous peoples’ own traditions for uncovering truth and enhancing reconciliation are embraced as an essential part of the ongoing process of truth determination, dispute resolution, and reconciliation.<!-- page 262 -->
No dialogue about reconciliation can be undertaken without mutual respect as shown through protocols and ceremony.<!-- page 262 -->
Just as the mace, for example, is essential to a session of Parliament, the presence of the pipe for some Tribes would be necessary to a formal process of reconciliation.<!-- page 262 --></p>
<p>The road to reconciliation also includes a large, liberal, and generous application of the concepts underlying Section 35(1) of Canada’s Constitution, so that Aboriginal rights are implemented in a way that facilitates Aboriginal peoples’ collective and individual aspirations.<!-- page 262 -->
The reconciliation vision that lies behind Section 35 should not be seen as a means to subjugate Aboriginal peoples to an absolutely sovereign Crown, but as a means to establish the kind of relationship that should have flourished since Confederation, as was envisioned in the Royal Proclamation of 1763 and the post-Confederation Treaties.<!-- page 262 -->
That relationship did not flourish because of Canada’s failure to live up to that vision and its promises.<!-- page 262 -->
So long as the vision of reconciliation in Section 35(1) is not being implemented with sufficient strength and vigour, Canadian law will continue to be regarded as deeply adverse to realizing truth and reconciliation for many First Nations, Inuit, and Métis people.<!-- page 262 -->
To improve Aboriginal peoples’ access to justice, changes must occur on at least two fronts: nationally, and within each Aboriginal community.<!-- page 262 --></p>
<p>The <em>United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples</em> and the UN “Outcome Document” provide a framework and a mechanism to support and improve access to justice for Indigenous peoples in Canada.<!-- page 262 -->
Under Article 40 of the <em>Declaration</em>,<!-- page 262 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Indigenous peoples have the right to access to and prompt decision through just and fair procedures for the resolution of conflicts and disputes with States or other parties, as well as to effective remedies for all infringements of their individual and collective rights.<!-- page 262 -->
Such a decision shall give due consideration to the customs, traditions, rules and legal systems of the indigenous peoples concerned and international human rights.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^44</a><!-- page 262 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 2013, the UN Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples issued a study, “Access to Justice in the Promotion and Protection of the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.”<!-- page 262 -->
It made several key findings that are relevant to Canada.<!-- page 262 -->
The international study noted that states and Indigenous peoples themselves have a critical role to play in implementing Indigenous peoples’ access to justice.<!-- page 262 -->
Substantive changes are required within the criminal legal system and in relation to Indigenous peoples’ rights to their lands, territories, and natural resources; political self-determination; and community well-being.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^45</a><!-- page 262 -->
The study made several key findings and recommendations, including the following:<!-- page 262 --></p>
<p>The right to self-determination is a central right for indigenous peoples from which all other rights flow.<!-- page 263 -->
In relation to access to justice, self-determination affirms their right to maintain and strengthen indigenous legal institutions, and to apply their own customs and laws.<!-- page 263 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The cultural rights of indigenous peoples include recognition and practice of their justice systems …<!-- page 263 -->
as well as recognition of their traditional customs, values and languages by courts and legal procedures.<!-- page 263 --></p>
<p>Consistent with indigenous peoples’ right to self-determination and self-government, States should recognize and provide support for indigenous peoples’ own justice systems and should consult with indigenous peoples on the best means for dialogue and cooperation between indigenous and State systems.<!-- page 263 --></p>
<p>States should recognize indigenous peoples’ rights to their lands, territories and resources in laws and should harmonize laws in accordance with indigenous peoples’ customs on possession and use of lands.<!-- page 263 -->
Where indigenous peoples have won land rights and other cases in courts, States must implement these decisions.<!-- page 263 -->
The private sector and government must not collude to deprive indigenous peoples of access to justice.<!-- page 263 --></p>
<p>Indigenous peoples should strengthen advocacy for the recognition of their justice systems.<!-- page 263 --></p>
<p>Indigenous peoples’ justice systems should ensure that indigenous women and children are free from all forms of discrimination and should ensure accessibility to indigenous persons with disabilities.<!-- page 263 --></p>
<p>Indigenous peoples should explore the organization and running of their own truthseeking processes.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^46</a><!-- page 263 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>These conclusions are consistent with this Commission’s own views.<!-- page 263 -->
We also concur with the 2014 report issued by S.<!-- page 263 -->
James Anaya, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, about the state of Canada’s relationship with Indigenous peoples.<!-- page 263 -->
He concluded that the<!-- page 263 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Government of Canada has a stated goal of reconciliation, which the Special Rapporteur heard repeated by numerous government representatives with whom he met.<!-- page 263 -->
Yet even in this context, in recent years, indigenous leaders have expressed concern that progress towards this goal has been undermined by actions of the Government that limit or ignore the input of indigenous governments and representatives in various decisions that concern them…<!-- page 263 -->
[D]espite positive steps, daunting challenges remain.<!-- page 263 -->
Canada faces a continuing crisis when it comes to the situation of indigenous peoples of the country.<!-- page 263 -->
The well-being gap between aboriginal and non-aboriginal people in Canada has not narrowed over the last several years, treaty and aboriginal claims remain persistently unresolved, indigenous women and girls remain vulnerable to abuse, and overall there appear to be high levels of distrust among indigenous peoples towards government at both the federal and provincial levels.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^47</a><!-- page 263 --><!-- page 264 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Canada, law must cease to be a tool for the dispossession and dismantling of Aboriginal societies.<!-- page 264 -->
It must dramatically change if it is going to have any legitimacy within First Nations, Inuit, and Métis communities.<!-- page 264 -->
Until Canadian law becomes an instrument supporting Aboriginal peoples’ empowerment, many Aboriginal people will continue to regard it as a morally and politically malignant force.<!-- page 264 -->
A commitment to truth and reconciliation demands that Canada’s legal system be transformed.<!-- page 264 -->
It must ensure that Aboriginal peoples have greater ownership of, participation in, and access to its central driving forces.<!-- page 264 -->
Canada’s Constitution must become truly a constitution for all of Canada.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^48</a><!-- page 264 -->
Aboriginal peoples need to become the law’s architects and interpreters where it applies to their collective rights and interests.<!-- page 264 -->
Aboriginal peoples need to have more formal influence on national legal matters to advance and realize their diverse goals.<!-- page 264 --></p>
<p>At the same time, First Nations, Inuit, and Métis peoples need greater control of their own regulatory laws and dispute-resolution mechanisms.<!-- page 264 -->
Aboriginal peoples must be recognized as possessing the responsibility, authority, and capability to address their disagreements by making laws within their communities.<!-- page 264 -->
This is necessary to facilitating truth and reconciliation within Aboriginal societies.<!-- page 264 --></p>
<p>Law is necessary to protect communities and individuals from the harmful actions of others.<!-- page 264 -->
When such harm occurs within Aboriginal communities, Indigenous law is needed to censure and correct citizens when they depart from what the community defines as being acceptable.<!-- page 264 -->
Any failure to recognize First Nations, Inuit, and Métis law would be a failure to affirm that Aboriginal peoples, like all other peoples, need the power of law to effectively deal with the challenges they face.<!-- page 264 --></p>
<p>The Commission believes that the revitalization and application of Indigenous law will benefit First Nations, Inuit, and Métis communities, Aboriginal–Crown relations, and the nation as a whole.<!-- page 264 -->
For this to happen, Aboriginal peoples must be able to recover, learn, and practise their own, distinct, legal traditions.<!-- page 264 -->
That is not to say that the development of self-government institutions and laws must occur at the band or village level.<!-- page 264 -->
In its report, the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples spoke about the development of self-government by Aboriginal nations:<!-- page 264 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>We have concluded that the right of self-government cannot reasonably be exercised by small, separate communities, whether First Nations, Inuit or Métis.<!-- page 264 -->
It should be exercised by groups of a certain size—groups with a claim to the term ‘nation’.<!-- page 264 --></p>
<p>The problem is that the historical Aboriginal nations were undermined by disease, relocations and the full array of assimilationist government policies.<!-- page 264 -->
They were fragmented into bands, reserves and small settlements.<!-- page 264 -->
Only some operate as collectivities now.<!-- page 264 -->
They will have to reconstruct themselves as nations.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^49</a><!-- page 264 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We endorse the approach recommended by the Royal Commission.<!-- page 264 --></p>
<p>Indigenous law, like so many other aspects of Aboriginal peoples’ lives, has been impacted by colonization.<!-- page 265 -->
At the TRC’s Knowledge Keepers Forum in 2014, Mi’kmaq Elder Stephen Augustine spoke about the Mi’kmaq concept for “making things right.”<!-- page 265 -->
He shared a metaphor about an overturned canoe in the river.<!-- page 265 -->
He said, “We’ll make the canoe right and …<!-- page 265 -->
keep it in water so it does not bump on rocks or hit the shore…<!-- page 265 -->
[When we tip a canoe] we may lose some of our possessions…<!-- page 265 -->
Eventually we will regain our possessions [but] they will not be the same as the old ones.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^50</a><!-- page 265 --></p>
<p>When we consider this concept in relation to residential schools, we have repeatedly heard that they caused great and obvious loss.<!-- page 265 -->
The Mi’kmaq idea for “making things right” implies that sometimes, in certain contexts, things can be made right—but the remedy might not allow us to recapture what was lost.<!-- page 265 -->
Making things right might involve creating something new as we journey forward.<!-- page 265 -->
Just as the Canadian legal system has evolved over time, Indigenous law is not frozen in time.<!-- page 265 -->
Indigenous legal orders adapt with changing circumstances.<!-- page 265 -->
The development and application of Indigenous law should be regarded as one element of a broader holistic strategy to deal with the residential schools’ negative effects.<!-- page 265 --></p>
<p>There are diverse sources of Indigenous law that hold great insight for pursuing reconciliation.<!-- page 265 -->
In 2012, the TRC partnered with the University of Victoria Faculty of Law’s Indigenous Law Clinic, and the Indigenous Bar Association, to develop a national research initiative, the “Accessing Justice and Reconciliation (AJR) Project.”<!-- page 265 -->
Working with seven community partners, the AJR project examined six different legal traditions across the country: Coast Salish (Snuneymuxw First Nation, Tsleil-Waututh Nation); Tsilhqot’in (Tsilhqot’in National Government); Northern Secwepemc (T’exelc Williams Lake Indian Band); Cree (Aseniwuche Winewak Nation); Chippewas of Nawash Unceded First Nation # 27); and Mi’kmaq (Mi’kmaq Legal Services Network, Eskasoni).<!-- page 265 --></p>
<p>The AJR report concluded that many more Aboriginal communities across the country would benefit from recovering and revitalizing their laws.<!-- page 265 -->
Doing so would enable First Nations, Inuit, and Métis communities to remedy community harms and resolve internal conflicts as well as external conflicts with governments more effectively.<!-- page 265 -->
Professor Val Napoleon, the project’s academic lead, and Hadley Friedland, the project coordinator, said,<!-- page 265 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>We believe there is much hope that even the process of intentionally and seriously continuing …<!-- page 265 -->
[this work] will contribute to a truly robust reconciliation in Canada…<!-- page 265 -->
This work is vital for the future health and strength of Indigenous societies and has much to offer Canada as a whole…<!-- page 265 -->
Legal traditions are not only prescriptive, they are descriptive.<!-- page 265 -->
They ascribe meaning to human events, challenges and aspirations.<!-- page 265 -->
They are intellectual resources that we use to frame and interpret information, to reason through and act upon current problems and projects, to work toward our greatest societal aspirations.<!-- page 265 -->
Finding ways to support Indigenous communities to access, understand and apply their own legal principles today is not just about repairing the immense damages from colonialism.<!-- page 265 --><!-- page 266 -->
As Chief Doug S. White III (Kwulasultun) puts it …<!-- page 266 -->
“Indigenous law is the great project of Canada and it is the essential work of our time.<!-- page 266 -->
It is not for the faint of heart, it is hard work.<!-- page 266 -->
We need to create meaningful opportunities for Indigenous and non-Indigenous people to critically engage in this work because all our futures depend on it.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^51</a><!-- page 266 --></p>

<p>Survivors are more than just victims of violence.<!-- page 266 -->
They are also holders of Treaty, constitutional, and human rights.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^52</a><!-- page 266 -->
They are women and men who have resilience, courage, and vision.<!-- page 266 -->
Many have become Elders, community leaders, educators, lawyers, and political activists who are dedicated to revitalizing their cultures, languages, Treaties, laws, and governance systems.<!-- page 266 -->
Through lived experience, they have gained deep insights into what victims of violence require to heal.<!-- page 266 -->
Equally important, they have provided wise counsel to political leaders, legislators, policymakers, and all citizens about how to prevent such violence from happening again.<!-- page 266 --></p>
<p>The Commission agrees with Anishinaabe scholar and activist Leanne Simpson, who has urged Canadians not to think about reconciliation in narrow terms or to view Survivors only as victims.<!-- page 266 -->
She said:<!-- page 266 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If reconciliation is focused only on residential schools rather than the broader set of relationships that generated policies, legislation, and practices aimed at assimilation and political genocide, then there is a risk that reconciliation will “level the playing field” in the eyes of Canadians…<!-- page 266 -->
I also worry that institutionalization of a narrowly defined “reconciliation” subjugates treaty and nation-based participation by locking our Elders—the ones that suffered the most directly at the hands of the residential school system—into a position of victimhood.<!-- page 266 -->
Of course, they are anything but victims.<!-- page 266 -->
They are our strongest visionaries and they inspire us to vision alternative futures.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^53</a><!-- page 266 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Speaking at the British Columbia National Event, Honorary Witness and former lieutenant governor of British Columbia, the Honourable Steven Point, said:<!-- page 267 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>We got here to this place, to this time, because Aboriginal Survivors brought this [residential schools] to the Supreme Court of Canada.<!-- page 267 -->
The churches and the governments didn’t come one day and say, “Hey, you know, we did something wrong and we’re sorry.<!-- page 267 -->
Can you forgive us?”<!-- page 267 -->
Elders had to bring this matter to the Supreme Court of Canada.<!-- page 267 -->
It’s very like the situation we have with Aboriginal rights, where nation after nation continues to seek the recognition of their Aboriginal title to their own homelands.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^54</a><!-- page 267 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Commission believes that Survivors, who took action to bring the history and legacy of the residential schools to light, who went to court to confront their abusers, and who ratified the Settlement Agreement, have made a significant contribution to reconciliation.<!-- page 267 -->
The Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada was not established because of any widespread public outcry, demanding justice for residential school Survivors.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^55</a><!-- page 267 -->
Neither did the Settlement Agreement, including the TRC, come about only because government and church defendants, faced with huge class-action lawsuits, decided it was preferable to litigation.<!-- page 267 -->
Focusing only on the motivations of the defendants does not tell the whole story.<!-- page 267 -->
It is important not to lose sight of the many ways in which Aboriginal peoples have succeeded in pushing the boundaries of reconciliation in Canada.<!-- page 267 --></p>
<p>From the early 1990s onward, Aboriginal people and their supporters had been calling for a public inquiry into the residential school system.<!-- page 267 -->
The Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples made this same recommendation in 1996.<!-- page 267 -->
A majority of Survivors ratified the Settlement Agreement, in part because they were dissatisfied with the litigation process.<!-- page 267 -->
Survivors wanted a public forum such as a truth and reconciliation commission so that Canada could hear their unvarnished truths about the residential schools.<!-- page 267 -->
Survivors also wanted a formal apology from Canada that acknowledged the country’s wrongdoing.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^56</a><!-- page 267 -->
Due in large part to their efforts, the prime minister delivered a national apology to Survivors on behalf of the government and non-Aboriginal Canadians.<!-- page 267 --></p>
<p>Although societal empathy for Aboriginal victims of abuse in residential schools is important, this alone will not prevent similar acts of violence from recurring in new institutional forms.<!-- page 267 -->
There is a need for a clear and public recognition that Aboriginal peoples must be seen and treated as much more than just the beneficiaries of public good will.<!-- page 267 -->
As holders of Treaty, constitutional, and human rights, they are entitled to justice and accountability from Canada to ensure that their rights are not violated.<!-- page 267 --></p>
<p>In his initial report, tabled in August of 2012, Pablo de Greiff, the first UN Special Rapporteur on the Promotion of Truth, Justice, Reparation and Guarantees of NonRecurrence, pointed out that in countries where prosecuting individual perpetrators of criminal acts involving human rights violations has been difficult, other measures such as truth-seeking forums, reparations, and institutional reforms are especially critical.<!-- page 267 -->
Such measures enable victims of state violence to develop some confidence in the legitimacy and credibility of the state’s justice system.<!-- page 267 --><!-- page 268 -->
But de Greiff cautions that implementing these measures alone does not guarantee that reconciliation will follow.<!-- page 268 -->
Apologies, commemoration, public memorials, and educational reform are also required in order to transform social attitudes and foster long-term reconciliation.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^57</a><!-- page 268 --></p>
<p>The Treaty, constitutional, and human rights violations that occurred in and around the residential school system confirm the dangers that exist for Aboriginal peoples when their right to self-determination is ignored or limited by the state, which purports to act “in their best interests.”<!-- page 268 -->
Historically, whenever Aboriginal peoples have been targeted as a specific group that is deemed by government to be in need of protective legislation and policies, the results have been culturally and ethnically destructive.<!-- page 268 --></p>
<p>For Aboriginal peoples in Canada, the protection and exercise of their right to self-determination is the strongest antidote to further violation of their rights.<!-- page 268 -->
In the coming years, governments must remain accountable for ensuring that Aboriginal peoples’ rights are protected and that government actions do, in fact, repair trust and foster reconciliation.<!-- page 268 -->
Repairing trust begins with an apology, but it involves far more than that.<!-- page 268 --></p>
</section></section><section class="section2" id="moving-from-apology-to-action"><h2><a class="toclink" href="#moving-from-apology-to-action">Moving from apology to action<!-- page 268 --></a></h2>
<p>From the outset, this Commission has emphasized that reconciliation is not a one-time event; it is a multi-generational journey that involves all Canadians.<!-- page 268 -->
The public apologies and compensation to residential school Survivors, their families, and communities by Canada and the churches that ran the residential schools marked the beginning, not the end, of this journey.<!-- page 268 -->
Survivors needed to hear government and church officials admit that the cultural, spiritual, emotional, physical, and sexual abuse that they suffered in the schools was wrong and should never have happened, but they needed more.<!-- page 268 --></p>
<p>The children and grandchildren of Survivors needed to hear the truth about what happened to their parents and grandparents in the residential schools.<!-- page 268 -->
At the Commission’s public events, many Survivors spoke in the presence of their children and grandchildren for the first time about the abuses they had suffered as children, and about the destructive ways of behaving they had learned at residential school.<!-- page 268 -->
Many offered their own heartfelt apologies to their families for having been abusive, or unable to parent, or simply to say “I love you.”<!-- page 268 --></p>
<p>Apologies are important to victims of violence and abuse.<!-- page 268 -->
Apologies have the potential to restore human dignity and empower victims to decide whether they accept an apology or forgive a perpetrator.<!-- page 268 -->
Where there has been no apology, or one that victims believe tries to justify the behaviour of perpetrators and evade responsibility, reconciliation is difficult, if not impossible, to achieve.<!-- page 268 -->
The official apologies from Canada and the churches sent an important message to all Canadians that Aboriginal peoples had suffered grievous harms at the hands of the state and church institutions in the schools, and that, as the parties responsible for those harms, the state and the churches accepted their measure of responsibility.<!-- page 268 --><!-- page 269 -->
The apologies were a necessary first step in the process of reconciliation.<!-- page 269 --></p>
<p>The history and destructive legacy of residential schools is a sober reminder that taking action does not necessarily lead to positive results.<!-- page 269 -->
Attempts to assimilate First Nations, Inuit, and Métis peoples into mainstream Canadian society were a dismal failure.<!-- page 269 -->
Despite the devastating impacts of colonization, Indigenous peoples have always resisted (though in some places not always successfully) attacks on their cultures, languages, and ways of life.<!-- page 269 --></p>
<p>If Canadians are to keep the promise of the apologies made on their behalf—the promise of “never again!”—then we must guard against simply replicating the assimilation policies of the past in new forms today.<!-- page 269 -->
As TRC Honorary Witness Wab Kinew said, “The truth about reconciliation is this: It is not a second chance at assimilation.<!-- page 269 -->
It should not be a kinder, gentler evangelism, free from the horrors of the residential school era.<!-- page 269 -->
Rather, true reconciliation is a second chance at building a mutually respectful relationship.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^58</a><!-- page 269 --></p>
<p>The words of the apologies will ring hollow if Canada’s actions fail to produce the necessary social, cultural, political, and economic change that benefits Aboriginal peoples and all Canadians.<!-- page 269 --></p>
<p>A just reconciliation requires more than simply talking about the need to heal the deep wounds of history.<!-- page 269 -->
Words of apology alone are insufficient; concrete actions on both symbolic and material fronts are required.<!-- page 269 -->
Reparations for historical injustices must include not only apology, financial redress, legal reform, and policy change, but also the rewriting of national history and public commemoration.<!-- page 269 --></p>
<p>In every region of the country, Survivors and others have sent a strong message, as received by this Commission: for reconciliation to thrive in the coming years, Canada must move from apology to action.<!-- page 269 --></p>
<section class="section3" id="canadas-apology"><h3><a class="toclink" href="#canadas-apology">Canada’s apology<!-- page 269 --></a></h3>
<p>June 11, 2008, was an important day for the Aboriginal peoples of Canada, and for the country as a whole.<!-- page 269 -->
It has come to be known as the “Day of the Apology,” the day when Prime Minister Stephen Harper, and the leaders of all other federal political parties, formally apologized in the House of Commons for the harms caused by the residential school system.<!-- page 269 -->
In their presentations to the TRC, many Survivors clearly recalled the day of the apology.<!-- page 269 -->
They recalled where they were, who they were with, and, most importantly, how they felt.<!-- page 269 -->
Many spoke of the intense emotions they had when they heard the prime minister acknowledge that it had been wrong for the government to have taken them away from their families for the purpose of “killing the Indian” in them.<!-- page 269 -->
They talked of the tears that fell when they heard the words “We are sorry.”<!-- page 269 --></p>
<p>Survivors and their families needed to hear those words.<!-- page 270 -->
They had lived with pain, fear, and anger for most of their lives, resulting from the abrupt separation from their families and their experiences at residential schools, and they wanted desperately to begin their healing.<!-- page 270 -->
They needed to have validated their sense that what had been done to them was wrong.<!-- page 270 -->
They wanted to believe that things would begin to change—not the schools, which had long been closed, but the attitude and behaviours that lay behind the existence of the schools.<!-- page 270 -->
They wanted to believe that the government that had so long controlled their lives and abused its relationship with them now “saw the light.”<!-- page 270 -->
They wanted to believe that the future for their children and their grandchildren would be different from their own experiences; that their lives would be better.<!-- page 270 -->
The apology gave them cause to think that their patience and perseverance through the trauma and negativity of their experiences in and beyond the residential schools had been worth the struggle.<!-- page 270 -->
It gave them hope.<!-- page 270 --></p>
<p>At the TRC’s Saskatchewan National Event, National Chief of the Assembly of First Nations Shawn A-in-chut Atleo said,<!-- page 270 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think as was heard here, what I’m so grateful for is that there’s a growing experience …<!-- page 270 -->
about the work of reconciliation…<!-- page 270 -->
How do communities reconcile?<!-- page 270 -->
Well, it begins with each and every one of us.<!-- page 270 -->
How fortunate I am as a young man to have spent time with my late grandmother.<!-- page 270 -->
I held her hand.<!-- page 270 -->
She was eighty-seven years old, still here.<!-- page 270 -->
During that apology, she said, “Grandson, they’re just starting to see us, they’re just beginning to see us.”<!-- page 270 -->
That’s what she said.<!-- page 270 -->
And she found that encouraging, because it’s the first step, actually seeing one another, having the silence broken and the stories starting to be told…<!-- page 270 -->
I think that’s where it begins, isn’t it?<!-- page 270 -->
Between us as individuals sharing the stories from so many different perspectives so that we can understand.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^59</a><!-- page 270 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The report of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples noted that for some time after settler contact, the relationship between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal peoples had been one of mutual support, co-operation, and respect.<!-- page 270 -->
Despite incidents of conflict, Aboriginal peoples’ acceptance of the arrival of Europeans, and their willingness to participate with the newcomers in their economic pursuits, to form alliances with them in their wars, and to enter into Treaty with them for a variety of purposes, showed a wish to coexist in a relationship of mutual trust and respect.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^60</a><!-- page 270 -->
That aspect of the relationship was confirmed on the non-Aboriginal side by evidence such as the Royal Proclamation of 1763 and the Treaty of Niagara of 1764, as discussed earlier.<!-- page 270 --></p>
<p>The trust and respect initially established ultimately were betrayed.<!-- page 270 -->
Since Confederation in 1867, the approach of successive Canadian federal governments to the Crown’s fiduciary obligation to provide education for Aboriginal peoples has been deeply flawed.<!-- page 270 -->
Equally important, the consequences of this broken trust have serious implications well beyond residential schools.<!-- page 270 -->
The trust relationship and Canada’s particular obligation to uphold the honour of the Crown with regard to Aboriginal peoples goes to the very heart of the relationship itself.<!-- page 270 --></p>
<p>As the original peoples who had occupied the lands and territories for thousands of years throughout the region that became Canada, Aboriginal peoples have unique legal and constitutional rights.<!-- page 271 -->
These rights arose from their initial occupation and ownership of the land, and were affirmed in the Royal Proclamation of 1763, which also decreed that the Crown had a special duty to deal fairly with, and protect, Aboriginal peoples and their lands.<!-- page 271 -->
Subsequently, the Dominion of Canada assumed this fiduciary obligation under Section 91(24) of the <em>Constitution Act, 1867</em>, which gave Parliament legislative authority over “Indians, and lands reserved for Indians.”<!-- page 271 -->
Section 35 of the <em>Constitution Act, 1982</em> also recognized and affirmed existing Aboriginal and Treaty rights.<!-- page 271 --></p>
<p>In several key decisions, Canadian courts have said that the federal government must always uphold the honour of the Crown in its dealings with Aboriginal peoples.<!-- page 271 -->
In <em>R. v. Sparrow</em> (1990), the Supreme Court ruled that “the Government has the responsibility to act in a fiduciary capacity with respect to aboriginal peoples.<!-- page 271 -->
The relationship between the Government and aboriginals is trust-like, rather than adversarial …<!-- page 271 -->
the honour of the Crown is at stake in dealings with aboriginal peoples.”<!-- page 271 -->
In Haida Nation v. British Columbia (Minister of Forests) (2004), the Supreme Court ruled that “in all its dealings with Aboriginal peoples, from the assertion of sovereignty to the resolution of claims and the implementation of treaties, the Crown must act honourably,” and that “the honour of the Crown …<!-- page 271 -->
is not a mere incantation, but rather a core precept that finds its application in concrete practices.”<!-- page 271 -->
In other words, the honour of the Crown is not merely an abstract principle, but one that must be applied with diligence.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^61</a><!-- page 271 --></p>
<p>In Manitoba Métis Nation Inc. v. Canada (Attorney General) (2013), the Métis Nation argued that when the Métis peoples negotiated an agreement with the federal government that would enable Manitoba to enter Confederation, “they trusted Canada to act in their best interests …<!-- page 271 -->
[and] to treat them fairly.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^62</a><!-- page 271 -->
The Supreme Court said that in 1870, the<!-- page 271 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>broad purpose of S. 31 of the Manitoba Act was to reconcile the Métis community with the sovereignty of the Crown and to permit the creation of the province of Manitoba.<!-- page 271 -->
This reconciliation was to be accomplished by a more concrete measure— the prompt and equitable transfer of the allotted public lands to the Métis children.<!-- page 271 -->
[para. 98]<!-- page 271 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ruling in favour of the Manitoba Métis Nation, the court observed that their “submissions went beyond the argument that the honour of the Crown gave rise to a fiduciary duty, raising the broader issue of whether the government’s conduct generally comported with the honour of the Crown” (para. 87).<!-- page 271 -->
The court found that although Section 31 promised that land grants to Métis peoples would be implemented “in the most effectual and equitable manner,” this did not happen.<!-- page 271 -->
“Instead, the implementation was ineffectual and inequitable.<!-- page 271 -->
This was not a matter of occasional negligence, but of repeated mistakes and inaction that persisted for more than a decade.<!-- page 271 -->
A government sincerely intent on fulfilling the duty that its honour demanded could and should have done better” (para. 128).<!-- page 271 --></p>
<p>For Treaty peoples or First Nations, the unilateral imposition of the <em>Indian Act</em>, including the residential school system, represents a fundamental breach of the Crown’s Treaty obligations and fiduciary duty to deal with them honourably in both principle and practice.<!-- page 272 --></p>
<p>The Crown’s position as a fiduciary with regard to Aboriginal peoples is clearly a complicated and potentially conflicting area of legal obligation.<!-- page 272 -->
As a fiduciary, the Crown, through the Government of Canada, has a legal obligation to act in the best interests of Aboriginal people to whom it owes a fiduciary obligation.<!-- page 272 -->
This is the same case for the Bureau of Indian Affairs in the United States, which is commonly referred to as a “Trustee.”<!-- page 272 -->
As a trustee, the Bureau of Indian Affairs has a similar obligation to act in the best interests of Native Americans, and to ensure that other government departments do not act in a manner that contravenes tribal rights and interests or the government’s lawful obligations.<!-- page 272 -->
In the United States, the Solicitor’s Opinions issued from time to time by the Department of the Interior, which has authority over the Bureau of Indian Affairs, are used to give direction to government generally as well as to explain and justify government action.<!-- page 272 -->
In Canada, it must be recognized that the federal Department of Justice has two important, and potentially conflicting, roles when it comes to Aboriginal peoples:<!-- page 272 --></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The Department of Justice Canada provides legal opinions to the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada (aandc) to guide the department in its policy development, legislative initiatives, and actions.<!-- page 272 -->
Those opinions, and the actions based on them, invariably affect Aboriginal governments and the lives of Aboriginal people significantly.<!-- page 272 -->
Often, those opinions are about the scope and extent of Aboriginal and Treaty rights, and often they form the basis upon which federal Aboriginal policy is developed and enacted.<!-- page 272 --></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Justice Canada also acts as the legal advocate for aandc and the government in legal disputes between the government and Aboriginal people.<!-- page 272 -->
In that capacity, it takes instruction from senior officials within the Department of Aboriginal Affairs when the department is implicated in legal actions concerning its responsibilities.<!-- page 272 -->
It gives advice about the conduct of litigation, the legal position to be advanced, the implementation of legal strategy, and the decision whether to appeal a particular court ruling.<!-- page 272 --></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Upholding the honour of the Crown, and disputing a legal challenge to an official’s or department’s action or decision, can sometimes give rise to conflicting legal obligations.<!-- page 272 --></p>
<p>In the Commission’s view, those legal opinions should be available, as of right and upon request, to Aboriginal peoples, for whom the Crown is a fiduciary.<!-- page 272 -->
Canadian governments and their law departments have a responsibility to discontinue acting as though they are in an adversarial relationship with Aboriginal peoples and to start acting as true fiduciaries.<!-- page 272 -->
Canada’s Department of Justice must be more transparent and accountable to Aboriginal peoples; this includes sharing their legal opinions on Aboriginal rights.<!-- page 272 -->
As noted above, there is precedent for making this change.<!-- page 272 -->
Not only has the United States Department of the Interior’s Office of the Solicitor made public its legal opinions on a range of issues affecting Native Americans, but also these are now widely available online.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^63</a><!-- page 272 --><!-- page 273 --></p>
<section class="section4" id="call-to-action_35"><h4><a class="toclink" href="#call-to-action_35">Call to Action<!-- page 273 --></a></h4>
<ol>
<li>We call upon the Government of Canada, as an obligation of its fiduciary responsibility, to develop a policy of transparency by publishing legal opinions it develops and upon which it acts or intends to act, in regard to the scope and extent of Aboriginal and Treaty rights.<!-- page 273 --></li>
</ol>
<p>One of the aspects of the Doctrine of Discovery that continues to assert itself to this day is the fact that court cases involving Aboriginal territorial claims have placed a heavy onus on Aboriginal claimants to prove that they were in occupation of land since first contact and that the rights claimed over the territory continued from then to the present.<!-- page 273 -->
The Commission believes that there is good reason to question this requirement, particularly in view of the fact that much of the record upon which courts rely is documentary proof or oral testimony from acknowledged Elder experts.<!-- page 273 -->
History shows that for many years after Confederation, Aboriginal claimants were precluded from accessing legal advice or the courts in order to assert their claims, and that many of their best Elder experts have passed on without having had an opportunity to record their evidence.<!-- page 273 --></p>
<p>The Commission believes that it is manifestly unfair for Aboriginal claimants to be held to the requisite standard of proof throughout legal proceedings.<!-- page 273 -->
However, it is reasonable to require that an Aboriginal claimant establish occupation of specified territory at the requisite period of time.<!-- page 273 -->
That could be at the time of contact or at the time of Crown assertion of sovereignty.<!-- page 273 -->
It is our view that once occupation has been proven, then the onus should shift to the other party to show that the claim no longer exists, either through extinguishment, surrender, or some other valid legal means.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^64</a><!-- page 273 -->
Therefore, we conclude that Aboriginal claims of title and rights should be accepted on assertion, with the burden of proof placed on those who object to such claims.<!-- page 273 --></p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>We call upon the Government of Canada, provincial and territorial governments, and the courts to adopt the following legal principles:<!-- page 273 --></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Aboriginal title claims are accepted once the Aboriginal claimant has established occupation over a particular territory at a particular point in time.<!-- page 273 --></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once Aboriginal title has been established, the burden of proving any limitation on any rights arising from the existence of that title shifts to the party asserting such a limitation.<!-- page 273 --></p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The report of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples emphasized that the restoration of civic trust is essential to reconciliation.<!-- page 274 -->
It concluded that “the purpose of engaging in a transaction of acknowledgement and forgiveness is not to bind Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people in a repeating drama of blame and guilt, but jointly to acknowledge the past so that both sides are freed to embrace a shared future with a measure of trust.”<!-- page 274 -->
The report added that “the restoration of trust is essential to the great enterprise of forging peaceful relations.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^65</a><!-- page 274 -->
The Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada agrees with these findings.<!-- page 274 --></p>
<p>For reconciliation to take root, Canada, as the party to the relationship that has breached that trust, has the primary obligation to do the work needed to regain the trust of Aboriginal peoples.<!-- page 274 -->
It is our view that at the time of Confederation, and in subsequent Treaty negotiations, Aboriginal peoples placed a great deal of faith in the words of those speaking for the Crown that the new relationship would be a positive one for both of them.<!-- page 274 -->
That faith was betrayed, however, by the imposition of the <em>Indian Act</em>, the development of the residential school system, and a series of other repressive measures.<!-- page 274 --></p>
<p>Survivors have indicated that despite the Settlement Agreement and Canada’s apology, trust has not yet been restored.<!-- page 274 -->
The Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s Indian Residential Schools Survivor Committee member Eugene Arcand said,<!-- page 274 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I was there at the apology.<!-- page 274 -->
I thought I was on my way to reconciliation when I heard the prime minister’s words, in a way, when his voice trembled…<!-- page 274 -->
It would be remiss of me to the Survivors of Saskatchewan and Survivors across this country to not talk about what’s happened since the apology.<!-- page 274 -->
It’s been difficult to talk on one side of my mouth about reconciliation and truth, and on the other side of my heart I have very intense feelings about the actions of the federal government, Prime Minister Harper who gave that apology, and the Ministry of Indian Affairs in the administration of this agreement and other acts of government that have been an assault on our people…<!-- page 274 --></p>
<p>[W]e as First Nations, Métis, and Inuit people, especially residential school Survivors, want to reconcile.<!-- page 274 -->
We really, really want to.<!-- page 274 -->
But it’s difficult when we see and feel and read what’s coming out of the House, provincially, federally, in regards to our wellbeing.<!-- page 274 -->
First, with the cuts to the Aboriginal Healing Foundation and other cuts that have happened in regards to education, in regards to our livelihood.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^66</a><!-- page 274 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A government apology sends a powerful symbolic message to citizens that the state’s actions were wrong.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^67</a><!-- page 274 -->
As important as Canada’s apology was, it did not simply mark a closure of the past.<!-- page 274 -->
It also created an opening for Canadians to begin a national dialogue about restoring Aboriginal peoples to a just and rightful place within Canada.<!-- page 274 -->
In their evaluation of where things stood in the years immediately following the apology, Aboriginal leaders identified a post-apology gap between the aspirational language of Canada’s apology and Aboriginal peoples’ continuing realities.<!-- page 274 -->
Closing this gap is vital to reconciliation.<!-- page 274 --></p>
<p>Speaking to the Senate on June 11, 2009, the first anniversary of Canada’s apology, Assembly of First Nations National Chief Phil Fontaine, who is also a Survivor, said,<!-- page 274 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a post-apology era, the honour of the Crown must be a defining feature in the new relationship where legal obligations are vigilantly observed, where First Nations are diligently consulted and accommodated on all matters affecting our lives, and our right to free, prior and informed consent is respected…<!-- page 275 -->
Let it be clear that First Nations care deeply about our human rights—the human rights of the women in our communities, our children, our families and our communities.<!-- page 275 --></p>
<p>The principles of reconciliation, such as mutual respect, coexistence, fairness, meaningful dialogue, and mutual recognition, are not empty words.<!-- page 275 -->
These principles are about action; that is, they give shape and expression to the material, political and legal elements of reconciliation.<!-- page 275 -->
It has been an eventful year in Canadian and global politics, society and the economy since last June.<!-- page 275 -->
First Nations have been affected by the decisions of the Government of Canada during this time…<!-- page 275 -->
Given the level of poverty among First Nations, our economies and communities are at an alarmingly high risk of sinking further into the bleakness and despair of poverty.<!-- page 275 -->
We, as a society, must not let this happen…<!-- page 275 --></p>
<p>If this partnership between all founding peoples of the federation is to be meaningful, mutual responsibility and accountability must also define the relationship…<!-- page 275 -->
Reconciliation then, implies a solemn duty to act, a responsibility to engage, and an obligation to fulfill the promises inherent in an advanced democratic and ethical citizenship.<!-- page 275 -->
That is, the Government of Canada—in fact, all, all members of Parliament in both houses—has a responsibility …<!-- page 275 -->
to bridge the past to a future in which the gap in the quality of life and well-being between Aboriginal and nonAboriginal people vanishes, where First Nations poverty is eradicated, where our children have the same opportunities and life chances as other children, and the promises of our treaties are fulfilled.<!-- page 275 --></p>
<p>Reconciliation must mean real change for all of our people in all the places we choose to live, change that addresses the wrongs in a way that brings all of us closer together.<!-- page 275 -->
Human rights, hope, opportunity and human flourishing are not the privilege of one group or one segment of Canadian society; they belong to all of us.<!-- page 275 -->
Achieving an apology is not an end point.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^68</a><!-- page 275 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>National reconciliation involves respecting differences and finding common ground to build a better future together.<!-- page 275 -->
Whether Survivors’ hopes on the day of Canada’s apology will ultimately be realized rests on our ability to find that common ground.<!-- page 275 --></p>
<p>Therefore, we believe that all levels of government must make a new commitment to reconciliation and accountability.<!-- page 275 -->
The federal government, First Nations, Inuit, and Métis peoples, and all Canadians will benefit from the establishment of an oversight body that will have a number of objectives, including assisting discussions on reconciliation and making regular reports that evaluate progress on commitments to reconciliation.<!-- page 275 -->
Progress on reconciliation at all other levels of government and civil society organizations also needs vigilant attention and measurement to determine improvements.<!-- page 275 -->
In terms of public education, it will be important to ensure all Canadians have the educational resources and practical tools required to advance reconciliation.<!-- page 275 --><!-- page 276 --></p>

<p>There is an old and well-accepted adage that states, “It takes a village to raise a child.”<!-- page 277 -->
The removal of Aboriginal children from their villages was seen as a necessary step in the achievement of assimilation.<!-- page 277 -->
However, not only did the Government of Canada take the children from their homes, but it also then proceeded to destroy the cultural and functional integrity of the communities from which the children came and to which they would return.<!-- page 277 --><!-- page 278 --></p>
<p>Christian teachings were a fundamental aspect of residential schools.<!-- page 278 -->
Aboriginal children were taught to reject the spiritual ways of their parents and ancestors in favour of the religions that predominated among settler societies.<!-- page 278 -->
As their traditional ways of worshipping the Creator were disparaged and rejected, so too were the children devalued.<!-- page 278 -->
They were not respected as human beings who were equally loved by the Creator just as they were, as First Nations, Inuit, or Métis peoples.<!-- page 278 -->
Rather, their Christian teachers saw them as inferior humans in need of being ‘raised up’ through Christianity, and tried to mould them into models of Christianity according to the racist ideals that prevailed at the time.<!-- page 278 -->
The impact of such treatment was amplified by federal laws and policies that banned traditional Indigenous spiritual practices in the children’s home communities for much of the residential school era.<!-- page 278 --></p>
<p>Spiritual violence occurs when<!-- page 278 --></p>
<ul>
<li>a person is not permitted to follow her or his preferred spiritual or religious tradition;<!-- page 278 --></li>
<li>a different spiritual or religious path or practice is forced on a person;<!-- page 278 --></li>
<li>a person’s spiritual or religious tradition, beliefs, or practices are demeaned or belittled; or<!-- page 278 --></li>
<li>a person is made to feel shame for practising his or her traditional or family beliefs.<!-- page 278 --></li>
</ul>
<p>There is plenty of evidence to support our conclusion that spiritual violence was common in residential schools.<!-- page 278 --></p>
<p>The effects of this spiritual violence have been profound and did not end with the schools.<!-- page 278 -->
At the Alberta National Event, Survivor Theodore (Ted) Fontaine could have spoken for many Survivors when he said, “I went through sexual abuse.<!-- page 278 -->
I went through physical abuse, mental, spiritual.<!-- page 278 -->
And I’ll tell you …<!-- page 278 -->
the one thing that we suffered [from] the most is the mental and spiritual abuse that we carried for the rest of our lives.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^69</a><!-- page 278 --></p>
<p>At the Saskatchewan National Event, Survivor and Elder Noel Starblanket, National Chief of the National Indian Brotherhood (later the Assembly of First Nations), talked about the intergenerational spiritual impacts of the residential schools.<!-- page 278 -->
He said, “My great-grandfather …<!-- page 278 -->
was the first one to be abused by these churches and by these governments, and they forced his children into an Indian residential school and this began that legacy.<!-- page 278 -->
They called him a pagan, a heathen …<!-- page 278 -->
and that was in the late 1800s.<!-- page 278 -->
So I’ve been living with that in my family since then.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^70</a><!-- page 278 --></p>
<p>That Christians in Canada, in the name of their religion, inflicted serious harms on Aboriginal children, their families, and communities was in fundamental contradiction to what they purported to be their core beliefs.<!-- page 278 -->
For the churches to avoid repeating their failures of the past, understanding how and why they perverted Christian doctrine to justify their actions is a critical lesson to be learned from the residential school experience.<!-- page 278 --></p>
<p>Between 1986 and 1998, all four Settlement Agreement churches offered apologies or statements of regret, in one form or another, for their attempts to destroy Indigenous cultures, languages, spirituality, and ways of life, and, more specifically, for their involvement in residential schools.<!-- page 279 -->
The United, Anglican, and Presbyterian churches followed similar pathways: individuals or committees at the national level of each church became aware that there might be a need to apologize, a decision-making process was established at the highest levels of the church, and the apology was subsequently issued through the moderator or primate who spoke for the whole church.<!-- page 279 --></p>
<p>Unlike the three Protestant denominations, the Roman Catholic Church in Canada does not have a single spokesperson with authority to represent all of its many dioceses and distinct religious orders.<!-- page 279 -->
The issuing of apologies or statements of regret was left up to each of them individually.<!-- page 279 -->
The result has been a patchwork of apologies or statements of regret that few Survivors or church members may even know exist.<!-- page 279 -->
Roman Catholics in Canada and across the globe look to the Pope as their spiritual and moral leader.<!-- page 279 -->
Therefore, it has been disappointing to Survivors and others that the Pope has not yet made a clear and emphatic public apology in Canada for the abuses perpetrated in Catholic-run residential schools throughout the country.<!-- page 279 --></p>
<p>On April 29, 2009, National Chief of the Assembly of First Nations Phil Fontaine, four other Aboriginal leaders, and five leaders from the Roman Catholic community in Canada travelled to Rome for a private audience with Pope Benedict XVI.<!-- page 279 -->
No recording of the private meeting was permitted, but the Vatican issued a communiqué describing what the Pope had said.<!-- page 279 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Given the sufferings that some indigenous children experienced in the Canadian Residential School system, the Holy Father expressed his sorrow at the anguish caused by the deplorable conduct of some members of the Church and he offered his sympathy and prayerful solidarity.<!-- page 279 -->
His Holiness emphasized that acts of abuse cannot be tolerated in society.<!-- page 279 -->
He prayed that all those affected would experience healing, and he encouraged First Nations people to continue to move forward with renewed hope.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^71</a><!-- page 279 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The media reported that National Chief Fontaine and other Aboriginal leaders who had met with the Pope said that the statement was significant for all Survivors.<!-- page 279 -->
Fontaine told <em>CBC News</em> that although it was not an official apology, he hoped that the Pope’s statement of regret would bring closure to the issue for residential school survivors.<!-- page 279 -->
“The fact that the word ‘apology’ was not used does not diminish this moment in any way,” he said.<!-- page 279 -->
“This experience gives me great comfort.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^72</a><!-- page 279 --></p>
<p>The Pope’s statement of regret was significant to those who were present, and was reported widely in the media, but it is unclear what, if any, impact it had on Survivors, and their families and communities, who were not able to hear the Pope’s words themselves.<!-- page 279 -->
Many Survivors raised the lack of a clear Catholic apology from the Vatican as evidence that the Catholic Church still has not come to terms with its own wrongdoing in residential schools, and has permitted many Catholic nuns and priests to maintain that the allegations against their colleagues are false.<!-- page 279 --><!-- page 280 -->
A statement of regret that children were harmed in the schools is a far cry from a full and proper apology that takes responsibility for the harms that occurred.<!-- page 280 --></p>
<p>The Commission notes that in 2010, Pope Benedict XVI responded to the issue of the abuse of children in Ireland differently and more clearly when he issued a pastoral letter, a public statement that was distributed through the churches to all Catholics in Ireland.<!-- page 280 -->
He acknowledged that the church had failed to address the issue of child abuse in Catholic institutions.<!-- page 280 -->
He said:<!-- page 280 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Only by examining carefully the many elements that gave rise to the present crisis can a clear-sighted diagnosis of its causes be undertaken and effective remedies be found.<!-- page 280 -->
Certainly, among the contributing factors we can include: inadequate procedures for determining the suitability of candidates for the priesthood and the religious life; insufficient human, moral, intellectual and spiritual formation in seminaries and novitiates; a tendency in society to favour the clergy and other authority figures; and a misplaced concern for the reputation of the Church and the avoidance of scandal, resulting in failure to apply existing canonical penalties and to safeguard the dignity of every person.<!-- page 280 -->
Urgent action is required to address these factors, which have had such tragic consequences in the lives of victims and their families.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^73</a><!-- page 280 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>He directly addressed those who were abused as children by church clergy:<!-- page 280 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>You have suffered grievously and I am truly sorry.<!-- page 280 -->
I know that nothing can undo the wrong you have endured.<!-- page 280 -->
Your trust has been betrayed and your dignity has been violated.<!-- page 280 -->
Many of you found that, when you were courageous enough to speak of what happened to you, no one would listen.<!-- page 280 -->
Those of you who were abused in residential institutions must have felt that there was no escape for your sufferings.<!-- page 280 -->
It is understandable that you find it hard to forgive or be reconciled with the Church.<!-- page 280 -->
In her name, I openly express the shame and remorse that we all feel.<!-- page 280 -->
At the same time, I ask you not to lose hope…<!-- page 280 -->
Speaking to you as a pastor concerned for the good of all God’s children, I humbly ask you to consider what I have said …<!-- page 280 -->
[and that] you will be able to find reconciliation, deep inner healing and peace.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^74</a><!-- page 280 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Canada, for more than a century, thousands of First Nations, Inuit, and Métis children were subjected to spiritual, emotional, physical, and sexual abuse in Catholic-run residential schools.<!-- page 280 -->
Other than a small private audience with Pope Benedict XVI in 2009, the Vatican has remained silent on the Roman Catholic Church’s involvement in the Canadian residential school system.<!-- page 280 -->
During the Commission’s hearings, many Survivors told us that they knew that the Pope had apologized to Survivors of Catholic-run schools in Ireland.<!-- page 280 -->
They wondered why no similar apology had been extended to them.<!-- page 280 -->
They said: “I did not hear the Pope say to me, ‘I am sorry.’ Those words are very important to me …<!-- page 280 -->
but he didn’t say that to the First Nations people.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^75</a><!-- page 280 --></p>

<p>Survivors made many statements to the Commission about Canada’s apology, but the same cannot be said for their response to church apologies.<!-- page 281 -->
It is striking that although Survivors told us a great deal about how churches have affected their lives, and how, as adults, they may or may not practise Christianity, they seldom mentioned the churches’ apologies or healing and reconciliation activities.<!-- page 281 -->
This was the case even though they heard church representatives offer apologies at the TRC’s National Events.<!-- page 281 -->
Their engagement with the churches was often more informal and personal.<!-- page 281 -->
Survivors who visited the churches’ archival displays in the TRC’s Learning Places picked up copies of the apologies and talked directly with church representatives.<!-- page 281 -->
They also had conversations with church representatives in the Churches Listening Areas and in public Sharing Circles.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^76</a><!-- page 281 --></p>
<p>When the late Alvin Dixon, Chair of the United Church of Canada’s Indian Residential School Survivors Committee, spoke to the Commission at the Northern National Event in Inuvik in 2011, he expressed what many other Survivors may have thought about all of the churches’ apologies.<!-- page 281 -->
He said,<!-- page 281 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The apologies don’t come readily.<!-- page 281 -->
They don’t come easily.<!-- page 281 -->
And when we heard the apology in 1986, those of us First Nations members of the United Church didn’t accept the apology but we agreed to receive it and watch and wait and work with the United Church to put some flesh, to put some substance to that apology.<!-- page 281 -->
And we all believed that apologies should be words of action, words of sincerity that should mean something…<!-- page 281 -->
Our task is to make sure that the United Church lives up to that apology in meaningful ways…<!-- page 281 --></p>
<p>You know, our work is just beginning and we’re going to hold the church’s feet to the fire, other churches and Canada to make sure that this whole exercise of healing goes on for as long as it takes for us to recover from the impacts of our experiences in those residential schools.<!-- page 281 --></p>
<p>The other issue that comes up that we are addressing is having our native spiritual practice condemned initially not just by the United Church but all churches …<!-- page 281 -->
well, we now have our church supporting Native spiritual gatherings and we’re going to host a national Native spiritual gathering in Prince Rupert this summer…<!-- page 281 --><!-- page 282 -->
So, we are very much holding the church’s feet to the fire and making sure that there are real commitments to putting life to the apologies.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^77</a><!-- page 282 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>What Alvin Dixon told us is consistent with what the Commission heard from Survivors about Canada’s apology.<!-- page 282 -->
Official apologies made on behalf of institutions or governments may be graciously received but are also understandably viewed with some skepticism.<!-- page 282 -->
When trust has been so badly broken, it can be restored only over time as Survivors observe how the churches interact with them in daily life.<!-- page 282 -->
He explained, in practical terms, how Survivors would continue to hold the churches accountable.<!-- page 282 -->
Apologies mark only a beginning point on pathways of reconciliation; the proof of their authenticity lies in putting words into action.<!-- page 282 -->
He emphasized how important it was to Survivors that the churches not only admit that condemning Indigenous spirituality was wrong, but also that they go one step further and actively support traditional spiritual gatherings.<!-- page 282 -->
That action, however, calls for ongoing commitment to educate church congregations into the future on the need for such action.<!-- page 282 --></p>

That’s what has helped me— the teachings of our Aboriginal culture and language.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^78</a><!-- page 282 -->
Losing the connections to their languages and cultures in the residential schools had devastating impacts on Survivors, their families, and communities.<!-- page 282 -->
Land, language, culture, and identity are inseparable from spirituality; all are necessary elements of a whole way of being, of living on the land as Indigenous peoples.<!-- page 282 -->
As Survivor and Anishinaabe Elder Fred Kelly has explained,<!-- page 282 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>To take the territorial lands away from a people whose very spirit is so intrinsically connected to Mother Earth was to actually dispossess them of their very soul and being; it was to destroy whole Indigenous nations.<!-- page 282 -->
Weakened by disease and separated from their traditional foods and medicines, First Nations peoples had no defence against further government encroachments on their lives.<!-- page 282 --><!-- page 283 -->
Yet they continued to abide by the terms of the treaties trusting in the honour of the Crown to no avail.<!-- page 283 -->
They were mortally wounded in mind, body, heart, and spirit that turned them into the walking dead.<!-- page 283 -->
Recovery would take time, and fortunately they took their sacred traditions underground to be practised in secret until the day of revival that would surely come…<!-- page 283 -->
I am happy that my ancestors saw fit to bring their sacred beliefs underground when they were banned and persecuted.<!-- page 283 -->
Because of them and the Creator, my people are alive and in them I have found my answers.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^79</a><!-- page 283 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jennie Blackbird, who attended the Mohawk Institute in Brantford, Ontario, explained it this way:<!-- page 283 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our Elders taught us that language is the soul of the nation, and the sound of our language is its cement.<!-- page 283 -->
Anishinaabemowin gives the ability to see into our future…<!-- page 283 -->
Anishinaabemowin gives us the ability to listen …<!-- page 283 -->
to what is going on around us and the ability to listen to what is happening inside of us.<!-- page 283 -->
Through seeing and listening, we can harvest what we need to sustain ourselves, and to secure the properties that will heal us.<!-- page 283 -->
Ever since I can remember as a child, speaking my language, it helped me to restore my inner harmony by maintaining my mental, emotional, physical, and spiritual well-being.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^80</a><!-- page 283 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Spiritual fear, confusion, and conflict are the direct consequences of the violence with which traditional beliefs were stripped away from Indigenous peoples.<!-- page 283 -->
This turmoil gives particular urgency to understanding the role of Canada’s churches in effecting reconciliation with Indigenous peoples.<!-- page 283 -->
A number of Survivors spoke to us about the many contradictions they now see between their adult knowledge of Christian ethics and biblical teachings and how they were treated in the schools.<!-- page 283 -->
These contradictions indicate the spiritual fear and confusion that so many Survivors have experienced.<!-- page 283 -->
Children who returned home from the residential schools were unable to relate to families who still spoke their traditional languages and practised traditional spirituality.<!-- page 283 -->
Survivors who wanted to learn the spiritual teachings of their ancestors were criticized and sometimes ostracized by their own family members who were Christian, and by the church.<!-- page 283 -->
Survivors and their relatives reported that these tensions led to family breakdown—such is the depth of this spiritual conflict.<!-- page 283 -->
The cumulative impact of the residential schools was to deny First Nations, Inuit, and Métis peoples their spiritual birthright and heritage.<!-- page 283 -->
In our view, supporting the right of Indigenous peoples to self-determination in spiritual matters must be a high priority in the reconciliation process.<!-- page 283 -->
To be consistent with the <em>United Nations Declaration</em>, Indigenous peoples, who were denied the right to practise and teach their own spiritual and religious beliefs and traditions, must now be able to do so freely and on their own terms.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^81</a><!-- page 283 -->
For many, this is not easily done.<!-- page 283 --></p>
<p>Many Survivors and their families continue to live in spiritual fear of their own traditions.<!-- page 283 -->
Such fear is a direct result of the religious beliefs imposed on them by those who ran the residential schools.<!-- page 283 -->
This long-internalized fear has spanned several generations and is difficult to shed.<!-- page 283 --><!-- page 284 -->
It is exacerbated by the fact that Christian doctrine today still fails to accord full and proper respect for Indigenous spiritual belief systems.<!-- page 284 --></p>
<p>If it were the Survivors alone who faced this dilemma, one could argue that they should be able to resolve this for themselves in whatever way they can, including with the assistance of trusted church allies.<!-- page 284 -->
However, the dilemma of spiritual conflict is more than a personal one to Survivors.<!-- page 284 -->
It is one that extends to their children and their grandchildren, who, in these modern times, realize that there is much more to their personal histories than what they have inherited from residential schools and Canadian society.<!-- page 284 -->
They realize that each Indigenous nation also has its own history and that such histories are part of who they are.<!-- page 284 -->
Young First Nations, Inuit, and Métis people today are searching for their identities, which include their own languages and cultures.<!-- page 284 --></p>
<p>Aboriginal parents want their children raised in a community environment that provides all of this.<!-- page 284 -->
However, there is often conflict within communities when those who have been influenced by the doctrines of the churches believe that to teach Indigenous cultural beliefs to their children is to propagate evil.<!-- page 284 -->
There are those who continue to actively speak out against Indigenous spiritual beliefs and to block or prohibit their practice.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^82</a><!-- page 284 --></p>
<p>To have a right that you are afraid to exercise is to have no right at all.<!-- page 284 -->
The <em>Declaration</em> asserts that governments (and other parties) now have an obligation to assist Indigenous communities to restore their own spiritual belief systems and faith practices, where these have been damaged or subjected to spiritual violence through past laws, policies, and practices.<!-- page 284 -->
No one should be told who is, or how to worship, their Creator.<!-- page 284 -->
That is an individual choice and, for Indigenous peoples, it is also a collective right.<!-- page 284 -->
However, First Nations, Inuit, and Métis people need to be assured that they do indeed have the freedom to choose and that their choice will be respected.<!-- page 284 --></p>
<p>All religious denominations in Canada must respect this right, but the United, Anglican, Presbyterian, and Catholic churches, as parties to the Settlement Agreement, bear a particular responsibility to formally recognize Indigenous spirituality as a valid form of worship that is equal to their own.<!-- page 284 -->
It cannot be left up to individuals in the churches to speak out when such freedom to worship is denied.<!-- page 284 -->
Rather, the churches, as religious institutions, must affirm Indigenous spirituality in its own right.<!-- page 284 -->
Without such formal recognition, a full and robust reconciliation will be impossible.<!-- page 284 -->
Healing and reconciliation have a spiritual dimension that must continue to be addressed by the churches in partnership with Indigenous spiritual leaders, Survivors, their families, and communities.<!-- page 284 --></p>
<p>Many Indigenous peoples who no longer subscribe to Christian teachings have found the reclaiming of their Indigenous spirituality important to their healing and sense of identity.<!-- page 284 -->
Some have no desire to integrate Indigenous spirituality into Christian religious institutions.<!-- page 284 -->
Rather, they believe that Indigenous spirituality and Western religion should coexist on separate but parallel paths.<!-- page 284 --></p>
<p>Elder Jim Dumont told the Commission about the importance of non-interference and mutual respect.<!-- page 284 -->
He said that the<!-- page 284 --></p>
<p>abuse and the damage that has been done in residential schools, one of the primary sources of that is the church.<!-- page 285 -->
And the church has to take ownership for that.<!-- page 285 -->
But what bothers me about it is that the church continues to have a hold on our people…<!-- page 285 -->
Just get out of the way for awhile so that we can do what we need to do because as long as you are standing there thinking that you are supporting us, you are actually preventing us from getting to our own truth about this and our own healing about this.<!-- page 285 -->
But I think the other thing that’s being avoided by the church is their need to reconcile with the Spirit…<!-- page 285 -->
I think that the church has to reconcile with the Creator…<!-- page 285 -->
I’m not a Christian but I have a high regard for this Spirit …<!-- page 285 -->
who is called Jesus…<!-- page 285 -->
What I think is that when the church can reconcile with their God and their Saviour for what they have done, then maybe we can talk to them about reconciling amongst ourselves.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^83</a><!-- page 285 --></p>
<p>In contrast, Aboriginal Christians who also practise Indigenous spirituality seek Indigenous and Christian spiritual and religious coexistence within the churches themselves.<!-- page 285 -->
United Church Rev.<!-- page 285 -->
Alf Dumont, the first speaker of the All Native Circle Conference, said,<!-- page 285 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Respect is one of the greatest teachings that come from the original people of this land.<!-- page 285 -->
Our ancestors followed that teaching when they met with their Christian brothers and sisters so many years ago.<!-- page 285 -->
They saw a truth and a sacredness they could not deny in Christian teachings.<!-- page 285 -->
Many were willing to embrace these teachings and leave their traditional teachings.<!-- page 285 -->
Some were willing to embrace the teachings but still wanted to hold to their own.<!-- page 285 -->
Some did not leave their own traditions, and when persecuted, went into hiding either deep in the mountains or deep inside themselves.<!-- page 285 -->
Many were suspicious of the way the [Christian] teachings were presented and how they were lived.<!-- page 285 -->
They were suspicious of the fact that they were asked to deny their own sacred teachings and ways and adopt only the new teachings they were given.<!-- page 285 -->
Why could they not take what they needed from these new understandings and still live from their own?<!-- page 285 -->
That was the understanding and teaching of holding respect for others’ beliefs.<!-- page 285 -->
It was the way of the first people.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^84</a><!-- page 285 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Presbyterian Rev. Margaret Mullin (Thundering Eagle Woman) put it this way:<!-- page 285 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Can the Rev. Margaret Mullin/Thundering Eagle [W]oman from the Bear Clan be a strong Anishinaabe woman and a Christian simultaneously?<!-- page 285 -->
Yes I can, because I do not have my feet in two different worlds, two different religions, or two different understandings of God.<!-- page 285 -->
The two halves of me are one in the same Spirit.<!-- page 285 -->
I can learn from my grandparents, European and Indigenous Canadian, who have all walked on the same path ahead of me.<!-- page 285 -->
I can learn from Jesus and I can learn from my Elders.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^85</a><!-- page 285 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Each of the Settlement Agreement churches has wrestled with the theological challenges and necessary institutional reforms that arise with regard to Indigenous spiritual beliefs and practices.<!-- page 285 -->
At the same time, Aboriginal church members have taken a leadership role to advocate for Indigenous perspectives and ensure that they are fully represented in the institutional structures, programs, and services of their respective churches.<!-- page 285 --><!-- page 286 --></p>
<p>The General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church of Canada in 2013 endorsed a report on the development of a theological framework for Aboriginal spirituality within the church.<!-- page 286 -->
The report noted “the need for Aboriginal Christians to be true to both their <em>Indigenous identity</em> and to their [Christian] faith,” and concluded, among other things, that “this conversation has the potential not simply to help us address our relationship as Presbyterians with Aboriginal people; it has the potential to contribute to the renewal of our church.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^86</a><!-- page 286 --></p>
<p>The Anglican Church has developed a vision for a self-governing Indigenous church to coexist within the broader institutional structure of the church.<!-- page 286 -->
In 2001, a strategic plan called “A New Agape” was formally adopted by the church’s General Synod meeting.<!-- page 286 -->
The plan set out the church’s vision for a<!-- page 286 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>new relationship …<!-- page 286 -->
based on a partnership which focuses on the cultural, spiritual, social and economic independence of Indigenous communities.<!-- page 286 -->
To give expression to this new relationship The Anglican Church of Canada will work primarily with …<!-- page 286 -->
Indigenous peoples for a truly Anglican Indigenous Church in Canada.<!-- page 286 -->
It is an important step in the overall quest for self-governance.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^87</a><!-- page 286 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 2007, the church appointed Rev.<!-- page 286 -->
Mark MacDonald as its first Indigenous National Bishop.<!-- page 286 --></p>
<p>The United Church has also examined its theological foundations.<!-- page 286 -->
In a 2006 report, “Living Faithfully in the Midst of Empire: Report to the Thirty-ninth General Council 2006,” the United Church responded to an earlier call from the World Council of Churches “to reflect on the question of power and empire from a biblical and theological perspective and take a firm faith stance against hegemonic powers because all power is accountable to God.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^88</a><!-- page 286 -->
The report recommended that further work be done, and a follow-up report, “Reviewing Partnership in the Context of Empire,” was issued in 2009.<!-- page 286 -->
The report’s theological reflection noted:<!-- page 286 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our development of the partnership model was an attempt to move beyond the paternalism and colonialism of 19th century missions.<!-- page 286 -->
The current work to develop right relations with Aboriginal peoples is an attempt to move beyond a history of colonization and racism.<!-- page 286 -->
This ongoing struggle to move beyond empire involves the recognition that our theology and biblical interpretation have often supported sexism, racism, colonialism, and the exploitation of creation…<!-- page 286 -->
Theologies of empire have understood God and men as separate from and superior to women, Indigenous peoples, and nature.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^89</a><!-- page 286 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 2012, the Executive of the General Council reported on the follow-up to the 2006 and 2009 reports on how to re-envision the church’s theological purpose and restructure its institutions by shifting from a theology of empire to a theology of partnership.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^90</a><!-- page 286 --></p>
<p>The Commission asked all the Settlement Agreement churches to tell us their views on Indigenous spirituality and what steps were being taken within their respective institutions to respect Indigenous spiritual practices.<!-- page 287 -->
In 2015, two of the Settlement Agreement churches responded to this call.<!-- page 287 --></p>
<p>On January 29, 2015, the Presbyterian Church in Canada issued a “Statement on Aboriginal Spiritual Practices.”<!-- page 287 -->
Among other things, the church said:<!-- page 287 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>As part of the Churches’ commitment to a journey of truth and reconciliation, the Presbyterian Church in Canada has learned that many facets of Aboriginal traditional spiritualities bring life and oneness with creation.<!-- page 287 -->
Accepting this has sometimes been a challenge for the Presbyterian Church in Canada.<!-- page 287 -->
We are now aware that there is a wide variety of Aboriginal spiritual practices and we acknowledge that it is for our church to continue in humility to learn the deep significance of these practices and to respect them and the Aboriginal elders who are the keepers of their traditional sacred truths…<!-- page 287 --></p>
<p>We acknowledge and respect both Aboriginal members of the Presbyterian Church in Canada who wish to bring traditional practices into their congregations and those Aboriginal members who are not comfortable or willing to do so.<!-- page 287 -->
The church must be a community where all are valued and respected.<!-- page 287 -->
It is not for the Presbyterian Church in Canada to validate or invalidate Aboriginal spiritualities and practices.<!-- page 287 -->
Our church, however, is deeply respectful of these traditions.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^91</a><!-- page 287 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>On February 18, 2015, the United Church of Canada issued a statement, “Affirming Other Spiritual Paths.”<!-- page 287 -->
The document sets out various statements and apologies made by the church with regard to Indigenous spirituality, including an expression of reconciliation at the TRC’s Alberta National Event on March 27, 2014.<!-- page 287 -->
Among other things, the church said:<!-- page 287 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In humility, the Church acknowledges its complicity in the degradation of Aboriginal wisdom and spirituality, and offers the following statements from its recent history.<!-- page 287 -->
In doing so, the Church recognizes with pain that this is a complex and sensitive issue for some within Aboriginal communities of faith, who as a result of our Christianizing work, and the legacy of colonialism, are on a journey to restore harmony and spiritual balance…<!-- page 287 --></p>
<p>We have learned that ‘good intentions’ are never enough, especially when wrapped in the misguided zeal of cultural and spiritual superiority.<!-- page 287 -->
Thus, we have learned that we were wrong to reject, discredit, and yes, even outlaw traditional indigenous spiritual practice and ceremony; in amazing circles of grace, as we have begun to listen to the wisdom of the Elders, we have found our own faith enriched and deepened.<!-- page 287 -->
And we are grateful.<!-- page 287 -->
We know we have a long journey ahead of us.<!-- page 287 -->
We are committed to make that journey in humility and partnership, engaging in the healing work of making “whole” our own spirituality, and acknowledging that holding both your spirituality and ours is possible through listening and learning with open hearts.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^92</a><!-- page 287 --><!-- page 288 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unlike the Protestant churches, in which theological reflection and institutional reform have been undertaken at the national level, the Roman Catholic Church in Canada’s approach to Indigenous spirituality has emphasized decision making at the local diocesan level.<!-- page 288 -->
However, in a submission to the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples in 1993, the Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops expressed its views on Indigenous spirituality:<!-- page 288 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Native spiritual voice is now finding greater resonance in the broader Christian and social worlds.<!-- page 288 -->
Native Christianity today is marked by the development of a theology that comes from Native prayer, culture, and experience…<!-- page 288 -->
As bishops, we have encouraged Native Catholic leaders to take increasing responsibility for the faith life of their communities…<!-- page 288 --></p>
<p>We also recognize that for some Native Peoples, Christianity and Native spirituality are mutually exclusive.<!-- page 288 -->
We are committed to responding to this belief in a spirit of dialogue and respect, and to encouraging Native Peoples to join in conversation between Christianity and Native spirituality…<!-- page 288 -->
We will continue to explore the possibility of establishing channels of communication between our own spiritual heritage and Aboriginal spiritualities.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^93</a><!-- page 288 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In terms of institutional reform, the Canadian Catholic Aboriginal Council, established in 1998, advises the Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops on issues regarding Aboriginal peoples within the Catholic Church.<!-- page 288 -->
The council’s mandate is to study and analyze “issues related to Catholic Aboriginal spirituality and education”; encourage “Aboriginal leadership in the Christian community”; support and promote “reconciliation in the context of the Catholic reality”; and serve “as an important link between Aboriginal Catholics and non-Aboriginal Catholics.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^94</a><!-- page 288 --></p>
<p>The Commission notes that all the Settlement Agreement churches have recognized the need to provide theological education and training for Aboriginal church members to take leadership positions within the churches and work in Aboriginal ministry programs.<!-- page 288 -->
Beginning in 2007, the Churches’ Council on Theological Education in Canada held a series of conferences that sought to encourage and deepen the exploration of questions with respect to Indigenous and Christian beliefs and the incorporation of Indigenous cultural and spiritual practices into Christian practices.<!-- page 288 -->
Through these events, the council also sought to challenge post-secondary institutions to consider how best to prepare theological students for ministry in Canada, in consideration not only of Indigenous people, their culture and spirituality, but also of the need for churches to engage in healing and reconciliation between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal peoples.<!-- page 288 --></p>
<p>The Toronto School of Theology made a public commitment to giving the same academic respect to Indigenous knowledge, including traditional Indigenous spiritual teachings, “as [to] traditions of Greek philosophy and modern science.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^95</a><!-- page 288 -->
This pledge was made at “The Meeting Place,” an event co-sponsored by Council Fire Native Cultural Centre and the Toronto Conference of the United Church of Canada in June of 2012.<!-- page 288 --><!-- page 289 --></p>
<p>Yet, more remains to be done in education and training with regard to reconciling Indigenous spirituality and Christianity in ways that support Indigenous self-determination.<!-- page 289 -->
Writing in 2009, the former Archdeacon for the Anglican Church and founding member of the Indian Ecumenical Conference, Rev.<!-- page 289 -->
John A. (Ian) MacKenzie, said,<!-- page 289 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most urgently, churches need to consider opening a serious dialogue with Aboriginal theologians, doctors, and healers who represent …<!-- page 289 -->
the North American intellectual tradition…<!-- page 289 -->
[Aboriginal peoples] call for recognition of the truth of past injustices and respect for their civilizations.<!-- page 289 -->
Most of all, this is a call for respect for their traditional religious thoughts and practices.<!-- page 289 -->
The only legitimate North American intellectual tradition comes from the diverse tribal societies in our midst!…<!-- page 289 --></p>
<p>Sustainable reconciliation will only take place when every Canadian seminary includes a course on Aboriginal religious traditions; when every congregation …<!-- page 289 -->
reflect[s] on North American intellectual tradition by initiating and inviting Aboriginal religious leaders to lead such discussions …<!-- page 289 -->
when Aboriginal peoples achieve real self-government within their churches; and when Christian theology not only respects Aboriginal thought, but learns from it.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^96</a><!-- page 289 --></p>

<p>Beginning in the 1990s, the four Settlement Agreement churches began allocating specific funds for community-based healing and reconciliation projects.<!-- page 289 -->
This work continued under the terms of the Settlement Agreement.<!-- page 289 -->
Each of the defendant churches agreed to provide and manage funds specifically dedicated to healing and reconciliation.<!-- page 289 -->
All the churches established committees, including Aboriginal representatives, to review and approve projects.<!-- page 289 --><!-- page 290 -->
In broad terms, the reconciliation projects funded by the Settlement Agreement churches have had three primary purposes:<!-- page 290 --></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Healing.<!-- page 290 -->
The Toronto Urban Native Ministry, funded by Anglican, United, and Roman Catholic churches, “reaches out to Aboriginal people on the street, in hospitals, in jails, shelters and hostels.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^97</a><!-- page 290 -->
The ministry works with all Aboriginal people who are socially marginalized and impoverished, including Survivors and intergenerational family members who have been impacted by residential schools.<!-- page 290 -->
Anamiewigumming Kenora Fellowship Centre, with funds from the Presbyterian Church in Canada, developed “A Step Up …<!-- page 290 -->
tools for the soul,” in partnership with local Aboriginal organizations.<!-- page 290 -->
Under the program, a series of ten teaching events led by Aboriginal Elders, teachers, and professionals were held to support Survivors and family members on their healing journey, featuring education about culture and tradition, with the goal of fostering reconciliation.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^98</a><!-- page 290 --></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Language and culture revitalization.<!-- page 290 -->
The Language Immersion Canoe Course in Tofino, British Columbia, funded by the United Church, focused on reconnecting Aboriginal youth to their homelands and cultures.<!-- page 290 -->
For one month, young Aboriginal people from Vancouver Island, including the community of Ahousaht, where the United Church operated a school, were taken to a remote and ancient Hesquiaht village site to learn the Hesquiah language through the art of canoe making.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^99</a><!-- page 290 --></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The Four Season Cultural Camps of the Serpent River First Nation in Ontario, funded by the Anglican Church, used traditional practices of harvesting, food storage, storytelling, and related ceremonies to promote language and culture.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^100</a><!-- page 290 -->
The Anglicans also supported a wilderness retreat for young people at the Nibinamik First Nation at Summer Beaver, Ontario.<!-- page 290 -->
It taught traditional life ways, while instilling a sense of self-confidence in the youth as they successfully completed the activities in the camp.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^101</a><!-- page 290 --></p>
<ol>
<li>Education and relationship building.<!-- page 290 -->
The Anglican and Roman Catholic churches still have relatively large numbers of Aboriginal members, so many of their initiatives focused on bringing their own Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal members together.<!-- page 290 -->
The Anglican Church has worked to help build understanding and counter stereotypes among its members through anti-racism training.<!-- page 290 -->
The Roman Catholic entities were among the core funders of the Returning to Spirit: Residential School Healing and Reconciliation Program.<!-- page 290 -->
The program brings Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal participants together to gain new insights into the residential school experience and develop new communication and relationship-building skills.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^102</a><!-- page 290 --></li>
</ol>
<p>The Settlement Agreement churches bear a special responsibility to continue to support the long-term healing needs of Survivors, their families, and communities who are still struggling with a range of health, social, and economic impacts.<!-- page 291 -->
The closure of the national Aboriginal Healing Foundation in 2014 when government funding ended has left a significant gap in funding for community-based healing projects, at the very time that healing for many individuals and communities is still just beginning.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^103</a><!-- page 291 -->
The churches must also continue to educate their own congregations and facilitate dialogue between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal peoples.<!-- page 291 -->
Much has been accomplished through the healing and reconciliation projects of the Settlement Agreement churches, but more remains to be done.<!-- page 291 --></p>

<p>Much of the current state of troubled relations between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Canadians is attributable to educational institutions and what they have taught, or failed to teach, over many generations.<!-- page 291 -->
Despite that history, or, perhaps more correctly, because of its potential, the Commission believes that education is also the key to reconciliation.<!-- page 291 -->
Educating Canadians for reconciliation involves not only schools and post-secondary institutions, but also dialogue forums and public history institutions such as museums and archives.<!-- page 291 -->
Education must remedy the gaps in historical knowledge that perpetuate ignorance and racism.<!-- page 291 --></p>
<p>But education for reconciliation must do even more.<!-- page 291 -->
Survivors told us that Canadians must learn about the history and legacy of residential schools in ways that change both minds <em>and</em> hearts.<!-- page 291 -->
At the Manitoba National Event in Winnipeg, Allan Sutherland said,<!-- page 291 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are still a lot of emotions [that are] unresolved.<!-- page 291 -->
People need to tell their stories…<!-- page 291 -->
We need the ability to move forward together but you have to understand how it all began [starting with] Christopher Columbus, from Christianization, then colonization, and then assimilation…<!-- page 291 --><!-- page 292 -->
If we put our minds and hearts to it, we can [change] the status quo.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^104</a><!-- page 292 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the Commission’s Community Hearing in Thunder Bay, Ontario, in 2010, Esther Lachinette-Diabo said,<!-- page 292 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m doing this interview in hope that we could use this as an educational tool to educate our youth about what happened…<!-- page 292 -->
Maybe one day the Ministry of Education can work with the TRC and develop some kind of curriculum for Native Studies, Indigenous learning.<!-- page 292 -->
So that not only Aboriginal people can understand, you know, what we had to go through—the experiences of all the Anishinaabe people that attended—but for the Canadian people as well to understand that the residential schools did happen.<!-- page 292 -->
And through this sharing, they can understand and hear stories from Survivors like me.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^105</a><!-- page 292 --></p>

<p>In Lethbridge, Alberta, in 2013, Charlotte Marten said,<!-- page 292 --></p>

<p>I would like to see action taken as a result of the findings of this Commission.<!-- page 292 -->
I would like to see the history of the residential school system be part of the school curriculum across Canada.<!-- page 292 -->
I want my grandchildren and the future generations of our society to know the whole truth behind Canada’s residential school policy and how it destroyed generations of our people.<!-- page 292 -->
It is my hope that by sharing the truth that it will help the public gain a better understanding of the struggles we face as First Nations.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^106</a><!-- page 292 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Non-Aboriginal Canadians hear about the problems faced by Aboriginal communities, but they have almost no idea how those problems developed.<!-- page 292 -->
There is little understanding of how the federal government contributed to that reality through residential schools and the policies and laws in place during their existence.<!-- page 292 -->
Our education system, through omission or commission, has failed to teach this.<!-- page 292 -->
It bears a large share of the responsibility for the current state of affairs.<!-- page 292 -->
It became clear over the course of the Commission’s work that most adult Canadians have been taught little or nothing about the residential schools.<!-- page 292 -->
More typically, they were taught that the history of Canada began when the first European explorers set foot in the New World.<!-- page 292 -->
Nation building has been the main theme of Canada’s history curricula for a long time, and Aboriginal peoples, with a few notable exceptions, have been portrayed as bystanders, if not obstacles, to that enterprise.<!-- page 292 --></p>
<p>Prior to 1970, school textbooks across the country depicted Aboriginal peoples as being either savage warriors or onlookers who were irrelevant to the more important history of Canada: the story of European settlement.<!-- page 292 -->
Beginning in the 1980s, the history of Aboriginal people was sometimes cast in a more positive light, but the poverty and social dysfunction in Aboriginal communities were emphasized without any historical context to help students understand how or why these happened.<!-- page 292 -->
This has left most Canadians with the view that Aboriginal people were and are to blame for the situations in which they find themselves, as though there were no external causes.<!-- page 292 --><!-- page 293 -->
Aboriginal peoples have therefore been characterized as a social and economic problem that must be solved.<!-- page 293 --></p>
<p>By the 1990s, textbooks emphasized the role of Aboriginal peoples as protestors, advocating for rights.<!-- page 293 -->
Most Canadians failed to understand or appreciate the significance of these rights, given the overriding perspective of Aboriginal assimilation in Canada’s education system.<!-- page 293 --></p>
<p>Although textbooks have become more inclusive of Aboriginal perspectives over the past three decades, the role of Aboriginal people in Canadian history during much of the twentieth century remains invisible.<!-- page 293 -->
Students learn something about Aboriginal peoples prior to contact, and during the exploration, fur-trade, and settlement periods.<!-- page 293 -->
They learn about Métis resistance in the 1880s, and the signing of Treaties.<!-- page 293 -->
Then, Aboriginal peoples virtually disappear until the 1960s and 1970s, when they resurface as political and social justice activists.<!-- page 293 -->
The defining period in between remains largely unmentioned.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^107</a><!-- page 293 -->
So much of the story of Aboriginal peoples, as seen through their own eyes, is still missing from Canadian history.<!-- page 293 --></p>
<p>In the Commission’s view, all students—Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal—need to learn that the history of this country did not begin with the arrival of Jacques Cartier on the banks of the St.<!-- page 293 -->
Lawrence River.<!-- page 293 -->
They need to learn about the Indigenous nations the Europeans met, about their rich linguistic and cultural heritage, about what they felt and thought as they dealt with such historic figures as Champlain, La Vérendrye, and the representatives of the Hudson’s Bay Company.<!-- page 293 -->
Canadians need to learn why Indigenous nations negotiated the Treaties and to understand that they negotiated with integrity and in good faith.<!-- page 293 -->
They need to learn about why Aboriginal leaders and Elders still fight so hard to defend those Treaties, what these agreements represent to them, and why they have been ignored by European settlers or governments.<!-- page 293 -->
They need to learn about what it means to have inherent rights, what those are for Aboriginal peoples, and what the settler government’s political and legal obligations are in those areas where Treaties were never negotiated.<!-- page 293 -->
They need to learn why so many of these issues are ongoing.<!-- page 293 -->
They need to learn about the Doctrine of Discovery—the politically and socially accepted basis for presumptive European claims to the land and riches of this country—and to understand that this same doctrine is now being repudiated around the world, most recently by the United Nations and the World Council of Churches.<!-- page 293 --></p>
<p>Survivors have also said that knowing about these things is not enough.<!-- page 293 -->
Our public education system also needs to influence behaviour by undertaking to teach our children— Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal—how to speak respectfully to, and about, each other in the future.<!-- page 293 -->
Reconciliation is all about respect.<!-- page 293 --></p>
<p>The Commission’s 2012 <em>Interim Report</em> made three recommendations directed at provincial and territorial governments:<!-- page 293 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Recommendation 4: The Commission recommends that each provincial and territorial government undertake a review of the curriculum materials currently in use in public schools to assess what, if anything, they teach about residential schools.<!-- page 294 --></p>
<p>Recommendation 5: The Commission recommends that provincial and territorial departments of education work in concert with the Commission to develop ageappropriate educational materials about residential schools for use in public schools.<!-- page 294 --></p>
<p>Recommendation 6: The Commission recommends that each provincial and territorial government work with the Commission to develop public education campaigns to inform the general public about the history and impact of residential schools in their respective jurisdictions.<!-- page 294 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>At various times, the Commission met with provincial and territorial education ministers from across Canada.<!-- page 294 -->
In July 2014, the Council of Ministers of Education, Canada (CMEC) gave us an update on the status of curriculum-development commitments across the country.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^108</a><!-- page 294 -->
The Commission was encouraged to see that progress has been made.<!-- page 294 -->
We note, however, that not all provinces and territories have yet made curriculum about residential schools mandatory, and not all courses cover the subject in depth.<!-- page 294 --></p>
<p>The Northwest Territories and Nunavut have taken a leadership role in developing and implementing mandatory curriculum about residential schools for all high school students, in engaging Survivors directly in the development of new materials, and in ensuring that teachers receive appropriate training and support, including direct dialogues with Survivors.<!-- page 294 -->
At the time of this writing, Yukon had begun the process of adapting the Northwest Territories and Nunavut materials for mandatory use in its territory.<!-- page 294 -->
Among the provinces, Alberta publicly declared that it was launching its own initiative to develop mandatory curriculum on the Treaties and residential schools for all students.<!-- page 294 --></p>
<p>These education initiatives are significant, but it will be essential to ensure that momentum is not lost in the years following the end of the Commission’s mandate.<!-- page 294 -->
To be successful over the long term, this and similar initiatives will require substantive and sustained support from provincial and territorial governments, educators, and local school districts.<!-- page 294 -->
An ongoing commitment from ministers of education throughout the country is critical.<!-- page 294 -->
The Commission notes that on July 9, 2014, the CMEC announced that education ministers<!-- page 294 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>agreed to additional pan-Canadian work in Aboriginal education to take place over the next two years, which will focus on four key directional ideas: support for Aboriginal students interested in pursuing teaching as a career; development of learning resources on Canadian history and the legacy of Indian Residential Schools that could be used by teacher training programs; sharing of promising practices in Aboriginal education; and ongoing promotion of learning about Indian Residential Schools in K–12 education systems.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^109</a><!-- page 294 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In regions where curriculum and teacher training on residential schools have been introduced, it will be necessary to build on these early successes and evaluate progress on an ongoing basis.<!-- page 294 --><!-- page 295 -->
Where education about residential schools is minimal, provincial and territorial governments can benefit from the lessons learned in jurisdictions that have made this material a mandatory requirement.<!-- page 295 --></p>
<p>The Commission notes that throughout the residential school era, Catholic and Protestant religious schools taught students only about their own religions.<!-- page 295 -->
Students were ill prepared to understand or respect other religious or spiritual perspectives, including those of Aboriginal peoples.<!-- page 295 -->
In our view, no religious school receiving public funding should be allowed to teach one religion to the complete exclusion of all other religions.<!-- page 295 -->
This is consistent with the Supreme Court of Canada decision in <em>S.L. v. Commission scolaire des Chênes</em> in 2012.<!-- page 295 -->
At issue was whether Québec’s mandatory Ethics and Religious Cultures Program, which was introduced in 2008 to replace Catholic and Protestant programs of religious and moral instruction with a comparative religions course taught from a neutral and objective perspective, violated charter rights of Catholic parents and children to be taught only Catholic religious beliefs.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^110</a><!-- page 295 -->
However, the court ruled:<!-- page 295 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Exposing children to a comprehensive presentation of various religions without forcing the children to join them does not constitute an indoctrination of students that would infringe the freedom of religion…<!-- page 295 -->
Furthermore, the early exposure of children to realities that differ from those in their immediate family environment is a fact of life in society.<!-- page 295 -->
The suggestion that exposing children to a variety of religious facts in itself infringes on religious freedom or that of their parents amounts to a rejection of the multicultural reality of Canadian society and ignores the Quebec government’s obligations with regard to public education.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^111</a><!-- page 295 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Commission believes that religious diversity courses must be mandatory in all provinces and territories.<!-- page 295 -->
Any religious school receiving public funding must be required to teach at least one course on comparative religious studies, which must include a segment on Aboriginal spiritual beliefs and practices.<!-- page 295 --></p>

<p>The Commission believes that to be an effective force for reconciliation, curriculum about residential schools must be part of a broader history education that integrates First Nations, Inuit, and Métis voices, perspectives, and experiences; and builds common ground between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal peoples.<!-- page 296 -->
The education system itself must be transformed into one that rejects the racism embedded in colonial systems of education and treats Aboriginal and Euro-Canadian knowledge systems with equal respect.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^112</a><!-- page 296 --></p>
<p>This is consistent with the <em>United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples</em>, which articulates the state’s responsibility with regard to public education and the promotion of respectful relationships between citizens, as follows:<!-- page 296 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Indigenous peoples have the right to the dignity and diversity of their cultures, traditions, histories and aspirations which shall be appropriately reflected in education and public information.[Article 15:1]<!-- page 296 --></p>
<p>States shall take effective measures, in consultation and cooperation with the indigenous peoples concerned, to combat prejudice and eliminate discrimination and to promote tolerance, understanding and good relations among indigenous peoples and all other segments of society.[Article 15:2]<!-- page 296 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fully implementing this national education framework will take many years, but will ensure that Aboriginal children and youth see themselves and their cultures, languages, and histories respectfully reflected in the classroom.<!-- page 297 -->
Non-Aboriginal learners will benefit, as well.<!-- page 297 -->
Taught in this way, all students, both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal, gain historical knowledge while also developing respect and empathy for each other.<!-- page 297 -->
Both elements will be vital to supporting reconciliation in the coming years.<!-- page 297 --></p>
<p>Developing respect for, and understanding of, the situation of others is an important but often ignored part of the reconciliation process.<!-- page 297 -->
Survivors’ testimonies compelled those who listened to think deeply about what justice really means in the face of mass human rights violations.<!-- page 297 -->
Teaching and learning about the residential schools are difficult for educators and students alike.<!-- page 297 -->
They can bring up feelings of anger, grief, shame, guilt, and denial.<!-- page 297 -->
But they can also shift understanding and alter world views.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^113</a><!-- page 297 -->
Education for reconciliation requires not only age-appropriate curriculum, but also ensuring that teachers have the necessary skills, supports, and resources to teach Canadian students about the residential school system in a manner that fosters constructive dialogue and mutual respect.<!-- page 297 --></p>
<p>Educating the heart as well as the mind helps young people to become critical thinkers who are also engaged, compassionate citizens.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^114</a><!-- page 297 -->
At the Alberta National Event, a youth delegation from Feathers of Hope, a project sponsored by Ontario’s Provincial Advocate for Children and Youth, offered an expression of reconciliation.<!-- page 297 -->
Samantha Crowe said,<!-- page 297 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Feathers of Hope began as a First Nations youth forum but it quickly [became] a movement of hope, healing, and positive change within northern Ontario’s First Nations communities.<!-- page 297 -->
You spoke passionately about wanting to learn about the past, and said that First Nations and non-First Nations people alike need to understand our history, and the impacts it still has on everything around us…<!-- page 297 -->
First Nations and non-First Nations people need to understand how colonization, racism, that residential schools still continue to negatively impact the quality of life in our communities.<!-- page 297 --></p>
<p>Everyone, especially the young people …<!-- page 297 -->
need to learn of Canada’s history, of our past, to truly try and understand our present.<!-- page 297 -->
This needs to be taught in school, but it also needs to be heard first-hand from our family, our friends, and our other community members.<!-- page 297 -->
This will begin the journey of healing together as a family or as a community because we can no longer live [with] a silence that hides our pain.<!-- page 297 -->
So while youth want to know of their past, they are ready to move forward.<!-- page 297 -->
They understand they need positive change, but they don’t want to do this alone.<!-- page 297 -->
We all need to come together so we can share, so we can grow, and then we can uplift one another, because that’s what reconciliation is about.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^115</a><!-- page 297 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Learning <em>about</em> the residential schools history is crucial to reconciliation, but can be effective only if Canadians also learn <em>from</em> this history in terms of repairing broken trust, strengthening a sense of civic responsibility, and spurring remedial and constructive action.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^116</a><!-- page 297 --><!-- page 298 -->
In a digital world, where students have ready access to a barrage of information concerning Treaties, Aboriginal rights, or historical wrongs such as residential schools, they must know how to assess the credibility of these sources for themselves.<!-- page 298 -->
As active citizens, they must be able to engage in debates on these issues, armed with real knowledge and deepened understanding about the past.<!-- page 298 --></p>
<p>Understanding the ethical dimension of history is especially important.<!-- page 298 -->
Students must be able to make ethical judgments about the actions of their ancestors while recognizing that the moral sensibilities of the past may be quite different from their own in present times.<!-- page 298 -->
They must be able to make informed decisions about what responsibility today’s society has to address historical injustices.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^117</a><!-- page 298 -->
This will ensure that tomorrow’s citizens are both knowledgeable and caring about the injustices of the past, as these relate to their own futures.<!-- page 298 --></p>

<p>For reconciliation to thrive in the coming years, it will also be necessary for federal, provincial, and territorial governments, universities, and funding agencies to invest in and support new research on reconciliation.<!-- page 298 -->
Over the course of the Commission’s work, a wide range of research projects across the country have examined the meaning, concepts, and practices of reconciliation.<!-- page 298 -->
Yet, there remains much to learn about the circumstances and conditions in which reconciliation either fails or flourishes.<!-- page 298 -->
Equally important, there are rich insights into healing and reconciliation that emerge from the research process itself.<!-- page 298 -->
Two research projects sponsored by the Commission illustrate this point.<!-- page 298 --></p>
<p>Through a TRC-sponsored project at the Centre for Youth &amp; Society at the University of Victoria, seven Aboriginal youth researchers embarked on a digital storytelling project, “Residential Schools Resistance Narratives: Strategies and Significance for Indigenous Youth.”<!-- page 298 -->
The project enabled youth researchers to learn about the critical role that resistance and resilience played in the residential schools and beyond, but also allowed them to reflect on their own identities and roles within their families and communities.<!-- page 298 -->
One youth researcher said that “what started as a research job turned into a personal hunt for knowledge of my own family’s history with residential schools.”<!-- page 298 -->
Others noted the importance of respecting and incorporating ceremony and protocols in their digital storytelling projects.<!-- page 298 -->
Asma Antoine, the project coordinator, reported that the group learned the importance of<!-- page 298 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>knowing that when speaking to a Survivor …<!-- page 298 -->
you have to hear their past before you can hear their understanding of resistance.<!-- page 298 -->
This project allowed the group [to have] a learning process that weaves [together] traditional [Indigenous] and Western knowledge to build our stories of resistance…<!-- page 298 -->
This research project has ignited a fire that shows in each digital story.<!-- page 298 -->
The passion of resistance that validates the survival<!-- page 298 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>and resiliency of First Nations people and communities provides hope for healing and reconciliation over the next seven generations.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^118</a><!-- page 299 --></p>
<p>In 2012, a digital storytelling project was undertaken by Aboriginal women at the Prairie Women’s Health Centre of Excellence: “Nitâpwewininân: Ongoing Effects of Residential Schools on Aboriginal Women—Towards Inter-Generational Reconciliation.”<!-- page 299 -->
Using ceremony and protocols throughout the project, the first workshop began with a pipe ceremony, followed by a Sharing Circle in which participants talked about their lives and the group discussed their individual and collective needs for support.<!-- page 299 -->
They later moved on to making videos of their individual stories, which were screened in March 2012 at the University of Winnipeg.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^119</a><!-- page 299 -->
One of the participants, Lorena Fontaine, said,<!-- page 299 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Reconciliation is about stories and our ability to tell stories.<!-- page 299 -->
I think the intellectual part of ourselves wants to start looking for words to define reconciliation.<!-- page 299 -->
And then there is the heart knowledge that comes from our life experiences.<!-- page 299 -->
It’s challenging to connect the two and relate it to reconciliation…<!-- page 299 -->
Without even thinking of the term reconciliation, I’m reminded about the power of story…<!-- page 299 -->
[People who watched the videos] said that when they saw the faces of Aboriginal women and heard their voices in the videos they understood assimilation in a different way.<!-- page 299 -->
They felt the impact of assimilation…<!-- page 299 -->
It’s far more powerful to have Aboriginal peoples talk about the impact of assimilation and hope for reconciliation than having words written down in a report.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^120</a><!-- page 299 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Research is vital to reconciliation.<!-- page 299 -->
It provides insights and practical examples of why and how educating Canadians about the diverse concepts, principles, and practices of reconciliation contributes to healing and transformative social change.<!-- page 299 --></p>
<p>The benefits of research extend beyond addressing the legacy of residential schools.<!-- page 299 -->
Research on the reconciliation process can inform how Canadian society can mitigate intercultural conflicts, strengthen civic trust, and build social capacity and practical skills for long-term reconciliation.<!-- page 299 -->
First Nations, Inuit, and Métis peoples have an especially strong contribution to make to this work.<!-- page 299 --></p>
<p>Research partnerships between universities and communities or organizations are fruitful collaborations and can provide the necessary structure to document, analyze, and report research findings on reconciliation to a broader audience.<!-- page 299 --></p>

<p>Education for reconciliation must happen not only in formal education settings such as elementary and secondary schools and post-secondary institutions, but in more informal places.<!-- page 300 -->
One of the ways that the Commission fulfilled its public education mandate was through forums such as National Event Education Days and Youth Dialogues.<!-- page 300 -->
The Commission believes that establishing a strong foundation for reconciliation depends on the achievement of individual self-respect and mutual respect between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Canadians.<!-- page 300 -->
While this is true for adults, it is particularly urgent with regard to young people; they are the lifeblood of reconciliation into the future.<!-- page 300 --></p>
<p>At the Saskatchewan National Event, Grade Eight student Brooklyn Rae, who attended the Education Day, said, “I think it’s really important for youth to voice their opinions, to not only prove to themselves that they can, that their voice is important, but to prove to adults that they have a voice and that they have a strong opinion that is important in the world.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^121</a><!-- page 300 -->
Elder Barney Williams, a member of the TRC’s Survivor Committee and one of the panellists at the Education Day Youth Dialogue, said,<!-- page 300 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think more and more people are realizing that the engagement of youth is crucial.<!-- page 300 -->
For me, as a Survivor, I’m really impressed with how much they knew.<!-- page 300 -->
I was very impressed with the type of questions the audience asked.<!-- page 300 -->
It tells me, as somebody who’s carried this pain for over sixty-eight years, that there’s hope.<!-- page 300 -->
Finally there’s hope on the horizon and it’s coming from the right place.<!-- page 300 -->
It’s coming from the youth.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^122</a><!-- page 300 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Commission agrees.<!-- page 300 -->
We believe that children and youth must have a strong voice in developing reconciliation policy, programs, and practices into the future.<!-- page 300 -->
It is therefore vital to develop appropriate public education strategies to support the ongoing involvement of children and youth in age-appropriate reconciliation initiatives and projects at community, regional, and national levels.<!-- page 300 --></p>
<p>Through direct participation in the TRC’s National Events, thousands of young people and their teachers across the country had the opportunity to learn about the residential schools and think about their own role and responsibility in reconciliation.<!-- page 300 -->
The TRC’s Education Days were designed specifically for elementary and high school students and their teachers.<!-- page 300 -->
Young people had the opportunity to listen to, and interact with, Elders and Survivors.<!-- page 300 -->
They attended interactive workshops where they learned about the residential school history, resilience, and healing through the arts—painting, carving, storytelling, music, and film.<!-- page 300 -->
They visited the Learning Places to walk through the Legacy of Hope Foundation display, “One Hundred Years of Loss,” and to see posters and archival photographs of the residential schools from their own region.<!-- page 300 --></p>
<p>Education Days were well attended.<!-- page 300 -->
For example, at the British Columbia National Event in Vancouver, approximately 5,000 elementary and high school students from across the province spent the day at the National Event.<!-- page 300 -->
In advance of Education Day, teachers in each region were given orientation materials to help prepare their students and themselves.<!-- page 300 --><!-- page 301 -->
In total, close to 15,000 young people across the country have participated in such Education Days, most with a commitment to take what they learned and witnessed back to their home schools to share with thousands more of their fellow students.<!-- page 301 --></p>
<p>Over the course of the TRC’s mandate, the Commission worked in partnership with the International Center for Transitional Justice’s (ICTJ) Children and Youth Program to host a series of small retreats and workshops.<!-- page 301 -->
Youth Dialogues were also integrated into Education Day activities at National Events.<!-- page 301 -->
Their purpose was to engage youth in dialogue and to support their efforts to make their own submissions to the TRC.<!-- page 301 -->
For example, in October 2010, the Commission co-sponsored an Aboriginal/non-Aboriginal youth retreat near Vancouver, British Columbia.<!-- page 301 -->
Young people came together to learn about the residential schools, talk with Elders, and share team-building activities.<!-- page 301 -->
One young participant said that during the retreat, “we learn[ed] more about each other and the past.<!-- page 301 -->
It’s really important because it actually teaches us, the stories that we heard it touched us, and it inspired us to become better people.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^123</a><!-- page 301 --></p>
<p>In June of 2011, Molly Tilden and Marlisa Brown, two young women who attended this retreat, produced their own video documentary, <em>Our Truth: The Youth Perspective on Residential Schools</em>.<!-- page 301 -->
The production featured interviews with their classmates in Yellowknife about what they knew about the residential schools.<!-- page 301 -->
They presented the video at the Northern National Event in Inuvik, Northwest Territories.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^124</a><!-- page 301 -->
Virginie Ladisch, director of ICTJ’s Children and Youth Program, summarized what the two young women found and the subsequent impact of the project.<!-- page 301 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The answers are shocking: some students had no knowledge, or simply complete indifference; those are largely the non-Aboriginal youth interviewed.<!-- page 301 -->
Other students talk about the enduring impact they see in terms of high rates of alcoholism, suicide, and teenage pregnancies.<!-- page 301 --></p>
<p>So there’s a huge disconnect in terms of how the young people view the relevance of this legacy and what knowledge they have of it.<!-- page 301 -->
When that video was shared with people involved in designing the secondary school curriculum for the Northwest Territories and Nunavut, they could not believe that their youth had such reactions.<!-- page 301 --></p>
<p>So the curriculum on residential schools, which was previously barely addressed in the classroom, was revised to be a mandatory 25 hours of instruction, of which Ms. Brown and Ms. Tilden’s video is a critical component.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^125</a><!-- page 301 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In October of 2011, the TRC–ICTJ initiative prepared and supported a group of Mi’kmaq youth reporters at the Halifax National Event.<!-- page 301 -->
They interviewed Survivors and documented the TRC event.<!-- page 301 -->
At a follow-up retreat in the community, the young reporters discussed their experiences and produced a documentary called <em>Our Legacy, Our Hope</em>.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^126</a><!-- page 301 -->
In 2012, the documentary was presented at the Youth Dialogue during the TRC’s National Event in Saskatchewan.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^127</a><!-- page 301 --><!-- page 302 -->
Some of the youth also presented this documentary to international policymakers at the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues in 2012.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^128</a><!-- page 302 --></p>
<p>The Commission’s interactions with youth indicated that young people care deeply about the past.<!-- page 302 -->
They understand that knowing the whole story about Canada’s history is relevant for today and crucial for their future.<!-- page 302 -->
This was evident, for example, in an expression of reconciliation made to the TRC at the Alberta National Event on March 27, 2014, by a group of Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal youth from the Centre for Global Education in Edmonton.<!-- page 302 -->
One of the non-Aboriginal youth, Hanshi Liu, told us about the project.<!-- page 302 -->
First, the group—made up of youth from First Nations reserves, the rural communities of High Prairie and Fort MacLeod, and the city of Edmonton—spent a month studying and talking about residential schools and their shared history.<!-- page 302 -->
They then held a virtual town hall where over 300 students talked about their vision for reconciliation.<!-- page 302 --></p>
<p>Emerald Blesse from Little River Cree Nation told us that “youth believe that reconciliation is the way to re-establish lost trust and open doors to positive and productive communications.<!-- page 302 -->
When we affirm every culture’s pride in their heritage, healing can take place…”<!-- page 302 -->
Hayley Grier-Stewart, representing the Kainai, Siksika, Tsuu T’ina, and Stony First Nations, said that “the youth believe that within our communities, we need to teach and create awareness, cultural appreciation, as well as healing and restoration.<!-- page 302 -->
If we introduce youth to the culture at a young age in our schools, through curriculum and the practice of restorative justice, it will teach the younger generation to be proactive instead of reactive.”<!-- page 302 -->
Métis youth Shelby Lachlan said that<!-- page 302 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>the youth of Alberta believe that in order to move forward, towards healing and reconciliation, it is important for action to be taken on a national and provincial level.<!-- page 302 -->
First we must re-establish trust between these two [Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal] collectives, and through the honouring, acknowledgement, and respect of all Treaties and settlements, we believe this can be achieved.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^129</a><!-- page 302 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Youth Forums and Dialogues are a vital component of education for reconciliation.<!-- page 302 -->
Non-profit organizations can play a key role in providing ongoing opportunities for Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal youth to participate in intercultural dialogue and work actively together to foster reconciliation.<!-- page 302 --></p>

<p>Museums and archives, as sites of public memory and national history, have a key role to play in national reconciliation.<!-- page 303 -->
As publicly funded institutions, museums and archives in settler colonial states such as Canada, New Zealand, Australia, and the United States have interpreted the past in ways that have excluded or marginalized Aboriginal peoples’ cultural perspectives and historical experience.<!-- page 303 -->
Museums have traditionally been thought of as places where a nation’s history is presented in neutral, objective terms.<!-- page 303 -->
Yet, as history that had formerly been silenced was revealed, it became evident that Canada’s museums had told only part of the story.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^130</a><!-- page 303 -->
In a similar vein, archives have been part of the “architecture of imperialism”—institutions that held the historical documents of the state.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^131</a><!-- page 303 -->
As Canada confronts its settler colonial past, museums and archives have been gradually transforming from institutions of colony and empire into more inclusive institutions that better reflect the full richness of Canadian history.<!-- page 303 --></p>
<p>Political and legal developments on international and national fronts have contributed to this change.<!-- page 303 -->
Around the globe, the adoption of the <em>United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples</em> has resulted in the growing recognition that Indigenous peoples have the right to be self-determining peoples and that the state has a duty to protect Indigenous traditional knowledge and cultural rights.<!-- page 303 -->
The Declaration also establishes that actions by the state that affect Indigenous peoples require their free, prior, and informed consent.<!-- page 303 -->
States have an obligation to take effective measures to protect the rights of Indigenous peoples or to make reparations where traditional knowledge or cultural rights have been violated.<!-- page 303 -->
This has significant implications for national museums and archives and the public servants who work in them.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^132</a><!-- page 303 --></p>
<p>The Commission emphasizes that several articles under the <em>United Nations Declaration</em> have particular relevance for national museums and archives in Canada.<!-- page 303 -->
These include:<!-- page 303 --></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Indigenous peoples have the right to practise and revitalize their cultural traditions and customs.<!-- page 303 -->
This includes the right to maintain, protect and develop the past, present and future manifestations of their cultures, such as archaeological and historical sites, artefacts, designs, ceremonies, technologies and visual and performing arts and literature.<!-- page 303 -->
[Article 11:1]<!-- page 303 --></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>States shall provide redress through effective mechanisms which may include restitution, developed in conjunction with indigenous peoples, with respect to their cultural, intellectual, religious and spiritual property taken without their free, prior and informed consent or in violation of their laws, traditions and customs.<!-- page 303 -->
[Article 11:2]<!-- page 303 --></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Indigenous peoples have the right to manifest, practise, develop and teach their spiritual and religious traditions, customs and ceremonies; the right to maintain, protect and have access in privacy to their religious and cultural sites; the right to use and control of their ceremonial objects; and the right to the repatriation of their human remains.[Article 12:1]<!-- page 303 --><!-- page 304 --></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>States shall seek to enable the access and/or repatriation of ceremonial objects and human remains in their possession through fair, transparent and effective mechanisms developed in conjunction with indigenous peoples concerned.[Article 12:2]<!-- page 304 --></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The <em>Declaration</em>, in conjunction with Section 35 of Canada’s <em>Constitution Act, 1982</em>, which recognizes and affirms existing Aboriginal and Treaty rights, and various court rulings related to Aboriginal rights have fundamentally altered the landscape in Canada’s public history institutions.<!-- page 304 -->
In light of court decisions that have declared that the principle of the honour of the Crown must be upheld by the state in all its dealings with Aboriginal peoples and that Aboriginal peoples’ oral history must be “placed on an equal footing” with written historical documents, national museums and archives have been compelled to respond accordingly.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^133</a><!-- page 304 -->
The governance structures, policies, ethical codes, and daily operations of national museums and archives have had to adapt to accommodate the constitutional and legal realities of Canada’s changing relationship with Aboriginal peoples.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^134</a><!-- page 304 --></p>
<section class="section3" id="canadas-national-museums"><h3><a class="toclink" href="#canadas-national-museums">Canada’s national museums<!-- page 304 --></a></h3>
<p>The 1996 <em>Report of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples</em> made a specific recommendation to Canada’s museums.<!-- page 304 --></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Museums and cultural institutions [should] adopt ethical guidelines governing all aspects of collection, disposition, display and interpretation of artifacts related to Aboriginal culture and heritage, including the following:<!-- page 304 --></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Involving Aboriginal people in drafting, endorsing and implementing the guidelines;<!-- page 304 --></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Creating inventories of relevant holdings and making such inventories freely accessible to Aboriginal people;<!-- page 304 --></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cataloguing and designating appropriate use and display of relevant holdings;<!-- page 304 --></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Repatriating, on request, objects that are sacred or integral to the history and continuity of particular nations and communities;<!-- page 304 --></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Returning human remains to the family, community or nation of origin, on request, or consulting with Aboriginal advisers on appropriate disposition, where remains cannot be associated with a particular nation;<!-- page 304 --></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensuring that Aboriginal people and communities have effective access to cultural education and training opportunities available through museums and cultural institutions. [Recommendation 3.6.4]<a href="footnote-placeholder">^135</a><!-- page 304 --></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In the years following the Royal Commission’s report, museums across the country have implemented many of its recommendations.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^136</a><!-- page 305 -->
Many have worked with communities to repatriate human remains or cultural artifacts.<!-- page 305 -->
For some institutions, consultation and collaborative partnerships with Aboriginal communities have become standard practice, and Aboriginal internships and other training opportunities have been established.<!-- page 305 -->
Yet, more is still needed, even as museums are faced with significant challenges in obtaining adequate and stable multi-year funding to properly support these critical initiatives.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^137</a><!-- page 305 --></p>
<p>Over the past three decades, Canadian museums that used to tell the story of the nation’s past with little regard for the histories of First Nations, Inuit, and Métis peoples are slowly transforming.<!-- page 305 -->
Although dialogue between museums and Aboriginal peoples has improved substantially since the 1980s, the broader debate continues over whose history is told and how it is interpreted.<!-- page 305 -->
Here, we focus on two national museums, the Canadian Museum of History (formerly the Canadian Museum of Civilization)138 and the Canadian Museum for Human Rights.<!-- page 305 -->
As national public history institutions, they bear a particular responsibility to retell the story of Canada’s past so that it reflects not only diverse cultures, history, and experiences of First Nations, Inuit, and Métis peoples, but also the collective violence and historical injustices that they have suffered at the hands of the state.<!-- page 305 -->
It is instructive to examine how these two public history institutions plan to interpret the history of Aboriginal peoples and address historical injustices in the coming years.<!-- page 305 --></p>
</section><section class="section3" id="canadian-museum-of-history"><h3><a class="toclink" href="#canadian-museum-of-history">Canadian Museum of History<!-- page 305 --></a></h3>
<p>Appearing before the House of Commons Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage in June 2013, Mark O’Neill, president and chief executive officer of the Canadian Museum of Civilization Corporation, acknowledged that many important aspects and milestones of Canadian history—including residential schools—have been missing from the museum.<!-- page 305 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>[P]erhaps the most egregious flaw in the Canada Hall is its starting point.<!-- page 305 -->
If you’ve been there, you will know that its telling of our national story begins not with the arrival of First Peoples but with the arrival of Europeans in the eleventh century.<!-- page 305 -->
Colonization as a term or concept is not mentioned in Canada Hall.<!-- page 305 -->
This is something we intend to correct.<!-- page 305 -->
Canadians made it very clear to us during the public engagement process that the voices and the experiences of First Peoples must have a place in any narrative of Canadian history…<!-- page 305 -->
Canadians want us to be comprehensive, frank and fair in our presentation of their history.<!-- page 305 -->
They want us to examine both the good and the bad from our past.<!-- page 305 -->
We were urged to foster a sense of national pride without ignoring our failings, mistakes and controversies.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^139</a><!-- page 305 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In July 2013, the Canadian Museum of Civilization and its partner, the Canadian War Museum, released a joint research strategy intended to guide the research activities at both institutions until 2023.<!-- page 305 -->
“Memory and commemoration” is a key research theme; objectives include the presentation of competing and contentious historical narratives of Confederation and the two world wars, and the use of “selected commemorations to explore concepts of myth, memory, and nation.”<!-- page 305 --><!-- page 306 -->
The museums intended to “present honestly, but respectfully, for public understanding issues of contention or debate …<!-- page 306 -->
[through] deliberate exploration of traumatic pasts (e.g.<!-- page 306 -->
Africville or residential schools).”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^140</a><!-- page 306 --></p>
<p>Drawing on research showing that Canadians valued their “personal and family connections to history,” the Canadian Museum of History said that it intended to “explore the realities of contemporary life for Canada’s First Peoples [including] cultural engagements with modernity, environmental change, and globalization, evolving concepts of tradition, political mobilization, and new avenues of social expression …<!-- page 306 -->
[and] the impact of rapid change in Canada’s North, especially for Inuit.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^141</a><!-- page 306 -->
Another key research theme is “First Peoples,” with a particular focus on Aboriginal histories.<!-- page 306 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The histories and cultures of Aboriginal peoples are central to all Canadians’ understanding of their shared past.<!-- page 306 -->
Respectful exploration of the interwoven, often difficult histories of Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Peoples is a responsible, timely contribution to contemporary Canada, and to global understanding of Aboriginal Peoples…<!-- page 306 -->
There are four principal objectives in exploring and sharing Aboriginal narratives…<!-- page 306 -->
1) Represent Aboriginal histories and cultures within broader Canadian narratives …<!-- page 306 -->
2) Explore inter-cultural engagement and its continuing impacts …<!-- page 306 -->
3) Broaden understanding of Aboriginal history before European contact …<!-- page 306 -->
[and] 4) Deepen efforts to support First Peoples’ stewardship.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^142</a><!-- page 306 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We are encouraged to note that much of what the museum’s research strategy emphasizes is consistent with our own findings: Canadians, including youth and teachers, think they should learn about the history and legacy of residential schools and Aboriginal history more broadly.<!-- page 306 -->
We take particular note of the prominence given to presenting both the positive and negative aspects of Canada’s history, demonstrating the relevance of the past to the present, including marginalized voices and perspectives, encouraging collaboration, and making connections between personal and public history.<!-- page 306 --></p>
</section><section class="section3" id="the-canadian-museum-for-human-rights"><h3><a class="toclink" href="#the-canadian-museum-for-human-rights">The Canadian Museum for Human Rights<!-- page 306 --></a></h3>
<p>As a national public history institution, the new Canadian Museum for Human Rights (CMHR) in Winnipeg is mandated to “explore the subject of human rights, with special but not exclusive reference to Canada, in order to enhance the public’s understanding of human rights, to promote respect for others, and to encourage reflection and dialogue.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^143</a><!-- page 306 -->
Speaking at the TRC’s Forum on the National Research Centre in Vancouver on March 3, 2011, CMHR President and Chief Executive Officer Stuart Murray talked about the museum’s vision for, and role in, national reconciliation.<!-- page 306 -->
He emphasized the prominent role of the CMHR’s First Nations, Inuit, and Métis advisors, as well as the Elders Advisory Council, Aboriginal Youth Council, and the broader Aboriginal community, in the planning and programs developed by the museum.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^144</a><!-- page 306 --><!-- page 307 --></p>
<p>Given the deep controversies that exist regarding the history of the residential school system, it is perhaps not surprising that the CMHR was criticized by the Southern Chiefs Organization in Manitoba in June of 2013, after media reports that the museum would not “label human rights violations against First Nations as genocide.”<!-- page 307 -->
From the Southern Chiefs Organization’s perspective, the museum was “sanitizing the true history of Canada’s shameful treatment of First Nations.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^145</a><!-- page 307 -->
Stuart Murray issued a statement on July 26, 2013, clarifying the museum’s position.<!-- page 307 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the Museum, we will examine the gross and systemic human rights violation of Indigenous peoples.<!-- page 307 -->
This will include information about the efforts of the Aboriginal community, and others, to gain recognition of these violations as genocide—and we will use that word.<!-- page 307 -->
We will look at the ways this recognition can occur when people combat denial and work to break the silence surrounding such horrific abuses…<!-- page 307 -->
We have chosen, at present, not to use the word “genocide” in the title for one of the exhibits about this experience, but will be using the term in the exhibit itself when describing community efforts for this recognition.<!-- page 307 -->
Historical fact and emerging information will be presented to help visitors reach their own conclusions.<!-- page 307 -->
While a museum does not have the power to make declarations of genocide, we can certainly encourage—through ongoing partnership with the Indigenous community itself—an honest examination of Canada’s human rights history, in hopes that respect and reconciliation will prevail.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^146</a><!-- page 307 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The museum signalled its intention to create opportunities for Canadians to engage in a much broader and long-overdue public dialogue about the issue of genocide as it relates to the residential school system.<!-- page 307 -->
The CMHR envisioned creating a public education venue for teaching all Canadians to think more critically about the history of human rights violations against Aboriginal peoples.<!-- page 307 --></p>
<p>Speaking about the forthcoming 2017 commemoration of Canada’s Confederation, Murray observed that Canada’s human rights record is not unblemished, and that<!-- page 307 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>for many Aboriginal communities, this is not necessarily an event that warrants celebration.<!-- page 307 -->
But by looking honestly and openly at our past, by engaging a diversity of voices and perspectives, and by celebrating what has been accomplished to overcome these mistakes, we will serve to make our nation more united, more proud, and more just.<!-- page 307 -->
We can use this anniversary to continue on a journey of reconciliation.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^147</a><!-- page 307 -->
The Commission believes that, as Canada’s 150th anniversary approaches in 2017, national reconciliation is the most suitable framework to guide commemoration of this significant historical benchmark in Canada’s history.<!-- page 307 -->
This intended celebration can be an opportunity for Canadians to take stock of the past, celebrating the country’s accomplishments without shirking responsibility for its failures.<!-- page 307 -->
Fostering more inclusive public discourse about the past through a reconciliation lens would open up new and exciting possibilities for a future in which Aboriginal peoples take their rightful place in Canada’s history as founding nations who have strong and unique contributions to make to this country.<!-- page 307 --><!-- page 308 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the Commission’s view, there is an urgent need in Canada to develop historically literate citizens who understand why and how the past is relevant to their own lives and the future of the country.<!-- page 308 -->
Museums have an ethical responsibility to foster national reconciliation, and not simply tell one party’s version of the past.<!-- page 308 -->
This can be accomplished by representing the history of residential schools and of Aboriginal peoples in ways that invite multiple, sometimes conflicting, perspectives, yet ultimately facilitate empathy, mutual respect, and a desire for reconciliation that is rooted in justice.<!-- page 308 --></p>
<p>The Canadian Museum of History and the Canadian Museum for Human Rights, working collaboratively with Aboriginal peoples, regional and local museums, and the Canadian Museums Association, should take a leadership role in making reconciliation a central theme in the commemoration of the 150th anniversary of Canada’s Confederation in 2017.<!-- page 308 --></p>
<p>It must be noted that although we have focused on national museums here, regional and local museums also have a critical role to play in creating opportunities for Canadians to examine the historical injustices suffered by First Nations, Inuit, and Métis peoples, engage in public dialogue about what has been done and what remains to be done to remedy this, and reflect on the spirit and intent of reconciliation.<!-- page 308 -->
Through their exhibits, education outreach, and research programs, all museums are well positioned to contribute to education for reconciliation.<!-- page 308 --></p>

<p>As Canada’s national archives, Library and Archives Canada (LAC) has a dual function with regard to its holdings on Aboriginal peoples.<!-- page 309 -->
It is both a public history institution tasked with making documents relevant to Aboriginal history accessible to the public, and it is the custodian of federal government departmental historical records.<!-- page 309 --></p>
<p>In 2005, LAC issued a “Collection Development Framework,” which set out the principles and practices that would guide the institution’s acquisitions and preservation of its holdings.<!-- page 309 -->
The framework made specific commitments regarding materials related to Aboriginal peoples.<!-- page 309 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>LAC recognizes the contributions of Aboriginal peoples to the documentary heritage of Canada, and realizes that, in building its collection of materials, it must take into account the diversity of Aboriginal cultures, the relationship the Government of Canada has with Aboriginal peoples, and the unique needs and realities of Aboriginal communities.<!-- page 309 -->
The development of a national strategy will be done in consultation and collaboration with Aboriginal communities and organizations, and will respect the ways in which indigenous knowledge and heritage is preserved or ought to be preserved and protected within or outside of Aboriginal communities.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^148</a><!-- page 309 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Library and Archives Canada has developed various guides and resources related to researching Aboriginal heritage.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^149</a><!-- page 309 -->
But a fundamental tension exists between LAC’s public education mandate to work collaboratively with Aboriginal peoples to document their cultural and social history versus its legal obligation to serve the state.<!-- page 309 -->
This tension is most evident where archived documents are relevant to various historical injustices involving Aboriginal peoples.<!-- page 309 -->
Historical records housed in LAC have been used extensively as evidence by both Aboriginal claimants and Crown defendants in litigation involving residential schools, Treaties, Aboriginal title and rights cases, and land claims.<!-- page 309 --></p>
<p>In the case of documents related to residential schools, the problems associated with LAC’s dual function became apparent during the litigation period prior to the Settlement Agreement.<!-- page 309 -->
During this time, with regard to its public education mandate, LAC produced “Native Residential Schools in Canada: A Selective Bibliography” in 2002, and assisted Aboriginal people, academics, and other researchers who wished to access these holdings.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^150</a><!-- page 309 -->
But, because the residential schools litigation put the federal government in the position of being the major defendant in the court cases, the overriding priority for LAC, as the custodian of federal government departmental records, was to meet its legal obligations to the Crown.<!-- page 309 --></p>
<p>Librarian and Archivist Emeritus Dr. Ian Wilson, Canada’s former national archivist, described this tension.<!-- page 309 -->
He explained that, as the residential school litigation intensified, &gt; Lawyers besieged the archives.<!-- page 309 --><!-- page 310 -->
Archivists, caught between the vagaries of old informal recordkeeping practices in church schools across the country, legal demands for instant and full access and obligations to employer and profession, struggled to uphold their ideal of the honest stewardship of the records…<!-- page 310 -->
This process has tested the capacity of the archives and our professional ability to respond.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^151</a><!-- page 310 --></p>
<p>These challenges did not end with the implementation of the 2007 Settlement Agreement.<!-- page 310 -->
The TRC’s own difficulties in gaining access to government records held in LAC demonstrated why state-controlled archives are not necessarily best suited to meet the needs of Survivors, their families, and communities.<!-- page 310 --></p>
<p>By 2009, in terms of public education, LAC had partnered with the Legacy of Hope Foundation and the Aboriginal Healing Foundation on two exhibitions: Where are the Children? Healing the Legacy of the Residential Schools;<!-- page 310 -->
and “We were so far away …”: The Inuit experience of residential schools.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^152</a><!-- page 310 -->
Library and Archives Canada also produced an updated online version of the bibliography, “The Legacy of the Residential School System in Canada: A Selective Bibliography.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^153</a><!-- page 310 -->
In 2010, LAC made an online finding aid available, “Conducting Research on Residential Schools: A Guide to the Records of the Indian and Inuit Affairs Program and Related Resources at Library and Archives Canada.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^154</a><!-- page 310 --></p>
<p>In the spirit of reconciliation, LAC archivists (along with church archivists) brought binders of residential school photographs to the Learning Places at the TRC’s National Events, where Survivors and others could see them and get copies of their class pictures and other school activities.<!-- page 310 -->
For many Survivors, especially those who had no visual record of their own childhood or no pictures of siblings who have since passed away, this proved to be one of the most treasured aspects of the National Events experience.<!-- page 310 -->
However, during this same time period, LAC’s holdings and its role in complying with the federal government’s legal obligations for document production, under the terms of the Settlement Agreement, became the focus of court proceedings between the TRC and the federal government.<!-- page 310 --></p>

<p>Schedule N to the Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement describes the mandate of the TRC as well as the obligations of the parties to the Agreement to assist the Commission in its work.<!-- page 310 -->
There is a provision that deals with the obligation of the parties to provide relevant records to the Commission.<!-- page 310 -->
It states:<!-- page 310 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In order to ensure the efficacy of the truth and reconciliation process, Canada and the churches will provide all relevant documents in their possession or control to and for the use of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, subject to the privacy interests of an individual as provided by applicable privacy legislation, and subject to and in compliance with applicable privacy and access to information legislation, and except for those documents for which solicitor-client privilege applies and is asserted.<!-- page 310 --><!-- page 311 --></p>
<p>In cases where privacy interests of an individual exist, and subject to and in compliance with applicable privacy legislation and access to information legislation, researchers for the Commission shall have access to the documents, provided privacy is protected.<!-- page 311 -->
In cases where solicitor-client privilege is asserted, the asserting party will provide a list of all documents for which the privilege is claimed.<!-- page 311 --></p>
<p>Canada and the churches are not required to give up possession of their original documents to the Commission.<!-- page 311 -->
They are required to compile all relevant documents in an organized manner for review by the Commission and to provide access to their archives for the Commission to carry out its mandate.<!-- page 311 -->
Provision of documents does not require provision of original documents.<!-- page 311 -->
Originals or true copies may be provided or originals may be provided temporarily for copying purposes if the original documents are not to be housed with the Commission.<!-- page 311 --></p>
<p>Insofar as agreed to by the individuals affected and as permitted by process requirements, information from the Independent Assessment Process (IAP), existing litigation and Dispute Resolution processes may be transferred to the Commission for research and archiving purposes.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^155</a><!-- page 311 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Gaining access to archival government records about the administration of the residential school system has been an important part of the mandate of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada.<!-- page 311 -->
Such access has been essential for our own understanding of the history of government policy and practice in relation to Aboriginal peoples in general and residential schools in particular.<!-- page 311 -->
But it has also been necessary to fulfilling our mandate obligation to ensure ongoing public access to the records through the National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation.<!-- page 311 -->
The Commission’s attempts to obtain records were frustrated by a series of bureaucratic and legal roadblocks.<!-- page 311 --></p>
<p>In April 2012, the Commission was compelled to file a “Request for Direction” in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice regarding access to relevant federal records housed in the national archives.<!-- page 311 -->
At issue was the question of what Canada’s obligations were under the Settlement Agreement with respect to providing to the TRC archived government documents housed at Library and Archives Canada.<!-- page 311 -->
The Commission, Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada, the Department of Justice, and Library and Archives Canada had very different views as to how the TRC should acquire these records.<!-- page 311 --></p>
<p>In LAC’s view, its role was that of the neutral keeper of government records, whose task was to facilitate and empower federal government departments to canvass their own archival holdings.<!-- page 311 --></p>
<p>Faced with the onerous task of conducting its own research through LAC’s vast holdings, Canada’s position was that its obligation was limited to searching and producing relevant documents from the active and semi-active files in various departments.<!-- page 311 -->
The government’s view became that departments need provide the TRC only with departmental researcher status to access their archived documents at LAC so that the Commission could conduct its own research.<!-- page 311 --><!-- page 312 --></p>
<p>The TRC’s position was that Canada was obligated to produce all relevant documents, including those at LAC, and had an additional obligation to provide the Commission with access to LAC in order to conduct its own research.<!-- page 312 -->
Although the TRC, in the spirit of co-operation, had agreed to obtain departmental researcher status, it maintained that this was unnecessary because the Settlement Agreement already gave the Commission unconditional access to the archives.<!-- page 312 -->
The end result was that Canada had effectively shifted the onus of its responsibility to produce LAC documents onto the TRC.<!-- page 312 --></p>
<p>In rendering his decision in favour of the Commission, Justice Stephen Goudge ruled:<!-- page 312 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In my view, the first paragraph of section 11 sets out Canada’s basic obligation concerning documents in its possession or control.<!-- page 312 -->
The plain meaning of the language is straightforward.<!-- page 312 -->
It is to provide all relevant documents to the TRC.<!-- page 312 -->
The obligation is in unqualified language unlimited by where the documents are located within the government of Canada.<!-- page 312 -->
Nor is the obligation limited to the documents assembled by Canada for production in the underlying litigation.[para. 69]<!-- page 312 --></p>
<p>I therefore conclude that given their meaning, the language in section 11 of Schedule N does not exclude documents archived at LAC from Canada’s obligation to the TRC.<!-- page 312 -->
The context in which the Settlement Agreement was created provides further important support for that conclusion in several ways.[para. 71]<!-- page 312 --></p>
<p>First, telling the history of Indian Residential Schools was clearly seen as a central aspect of the mandate of the TRC when the Settlement Agreement was made.<!-- page 312 -->
Since Canada played a vital role in the IRS [Indian Residential School] system, Canada’s documents wherever they were held, would have been understood as a very important historical resource for this purpose.[para. 72]<!-- page 312 --></p>
<p>Second, the Settlement Agreement charged the TRC with compiling an historical record of the IRS system to be accessible to the public in the future.<!-- page 312 -->
Here too, Canada’s documents, wherever housed, would have been seen to be vital to this task.[para. 73]<!-- page 312 --></p>
<p>Third, the story of the history and the historical record to be compiled cover over 100 years and dates back to the nineteenth century.<!-- page 312 -->
In light of this time span, it would have been understood at the time of the Settlement Agreement that much of the relevant documentary record in Canada’s possession would be archived in LAC and would no longer be in the active or semi-active files of the departments of the Government of Canada.[para. 74]<!-- page 312 --></p>
<p>Fourth, it would have been obvious that the experienced staff at LAC would have vastly more ability to identify and organize the relevant documents at LAC than would the newly hired staff of the newly formed TRC.<!-- page 312 -->
It would have made little sense to give that task to the latter rather than the former, particularly given its importance to the TRC’s mandate.<!-- page 312 --><!-- page 313 -->
[para.<!-- page 313 -->

</blockquote>
<p>Although the difficulties the TRC encountered in obtaining LAC documents were specific to the Commission’s mandate, they highlight broader questions concerning the role of state archives and archivists in providing documents that reveal the facts of why and how a targeted group of people have suffered harms on a massive scale.<!-- page 313 -->
As part of a growing trend towards demanding better government accountability and transparency, and the evolution of new privacy and freedom of information legislation, archives have become more directly connected to struggles for human rights and justice.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^157</a><!-- page 313 --></p>
</section><section class="section3" id="archives-and-access-to-justice"><h3><a class="toclink" href="#archives-and-access-to-justice">Archives and access to justice<!-- page 313 --></a></h3>
<p>Library and Archives Canada’s federal government departmental records pertaining to Aboriginal peoples are vital to understanding how human rights violations occurred and their subsequent impacts.<!-- page 313 -->
In 2005, the United Nations adopted the <em>Joinet-Orentlicher Principles</em>, which set out remedial measures that states must undertake to satisfy their duty to guard against impunity from past human rights violations and prevent their reoccurrence.<!-- page 313 -->
This includes victims’ right to know the truth about what happened to them and their missing family members.<!-- page 313 -->
Society at large also has the right to know the truth about what happened in the past and what circumstances led to mass human rights violations.<!-- page 313 -->
The state has a duty to safeguard this knowledge and to ensure that proper documentation is preserved in archives and history books.<!-- page 313 --></p>
<p>The <em>Joinet-Orentlicher Principles</em> state, “The full and effective exercise of the right to truth is ensured through preservation of archives.”<!-- page 313 -->
Equally important, ready access to the archives must be facilitated for victims and their relatives, and for the purposes of research (principles 5, 14, 15, 16).<a href="footnote-placeholder">^158</a><!-- page 313 --></p>
<p>The Commission notes that in his August 2013 report to the United Nations Human Rights Council, Pablo de Greiff, Special Rapporteur on the Promotion of Truth, Justice, Reparation and Guarantees of Non-Recurrence, made specific reference to the importance of archives.<!-- page 313 -->
He found that both a truth commission’s own records and those housed in national, regional, and local archives extend the life and legacy of the truth commission’s work.<!-- page 313 -->
Archives can serve as permanent sites where post-commission accountability and the right to truth can be realized.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^159</a><!-- page 313 -->
He further explained that archives “are a means of guaranteeing that the voices of victims will not be lost, and they contribute to a culture of memorialisation and remembrance.<!-- page 313 -->
They also provide a safeguard against revisionism and denial—essential given the long duration and non-linearity of social reconciliation and integration processes.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^160</a><!-- page 313 -->
He concluded that “truth commissions and national archives contribute in a substantial manner to realizing the right to truth and may further criminal prosecutions, reparations, and institutional and personnel reforms,” and recommended that international archival standards be established.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^161</a><!-- page 313 --><!-- page 314 --></p>
<p>Although de Greiff does not reference Indigenous peoples specifically, we note that in many countries, including Canada, the access to, and protection of, historical records have been instrumental in advancing the rights of Indigenous peoples and documenting the state’s wrongful actions.<!-- page 314 -->
In the wake of the South African and other truth commissions, some archivists have come to see themselves not simply as neutral custodians of national history, but also as professionals who are responsible for ensuring that records documenting past injustices are preserved and used to strengthen government accountability and support justice.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^162</a><!-- page 314 --></p>

<p>Over the course of the Commission’s work, many Aboriginal people spoke to us about the children who never came home from residential school.<!-- page 315 -->
The question of what happened to their loved ones and where they were laid to rest has haunted families and communities.<!-- page 315 -->
Throughout the history of Canada’s residential school system, there was no effort to record across the entire system the number of students who died while attending the schools each year.<!-- page 315 -->
The National Residential School Student Death Register, established by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada, represents the first national effort to record the names of the students who died at school.<!-- page 315 -->
The register is far from complete: there are, for example, many relevant documents that have yet to be received, collected, and reviewed.<!-- page 315 --></p>
<p>Some of these records have been located in provincial records.<!-- page 315 -->
In June 2012, at their annual general meeting, the Chief Coroners and Medical Examiners of Canada approved a unanimous resolution to support the TRC’s Missing Children Project by making available to the Commission their records on the deaths of Aboriginal children in the care of residential school authorities.<!-- page 315 -->
The Office of the Chief Coroner of Ontario had already done some groundbreaking work in terms of screening and reviewing its records, and identifying 120 possible cases of death of an Aboriginal residential school student.<!-- page 315 -->
The TRC subsequently contacted chief coroners across the country to request their assistance in locating records related to deaths at residential school.<!-- page 315 -->
As of 2014, chief coroners’ offices in Saskatchewan, Northwest Territories, Manitoba, and Nova Scotia had also responded to the Commission’s request for records.<!-- page 315 --></p>
<p>Other regional agencies also hold critical information in their records.<!-- page 315 -->
The TRC contacted offices of provincial vital statistics across the country.<!-- page 315 -->
At the Alberta National Event, Assistant Deputy Minister Peter Cunningham, from the Ministry of Aboriginal Relations and Reconciliation in British Columbia, offered a flash drive in a small, carved, bentwood box, as an expression of reconciliation.<!-- page 315 -->
He said,<!-- page 315 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think it’s incredibly important that all of the information comes out about what was a very deeply dark and disturbing event in Canadian history …<!-- page 315 -->
residential schools…<!-- page 315 -->
I’m here today to add to that body of knowledge on behalf of the government of British Columbia and the Vital Statistics Agency of bc…<!-- page 315 -->
The information on this flash drive is information about Aboriginal children between the ages of 4 and 19 years of age who died in British Columbia between the years 1870 and 1984.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^163</a><!-- page 315 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As of 2014, in addition to the office in British Columbia, vital statistics offices in Alberta, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Saskatchewan, Yukon, and Nunavut had responded to the Commission’s request for records.<!-- page 315 -->
To complete the work begun by the Commission on the National Residential School Student Death Register, it will be critical for the National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation to obtain all records related to the deaths of residential school students.<!-- page 315 --></p>

<p>We call upon the federal government to work with churches, Aboriginal communities, and former residential school students to establish and maintain an online registry of residential school cemeteries, including, where possible, plot maps showing the location of deceased residential school children.<!-- page 316 --></p>

<li>
<p>We call upon the federal government to work with the churches and Aboriginal community leaders to inform the families of children who died at residential schools of the child’s burial location, and to respond to families’ wishes for appropriate commemoration ceremonies and markers, and reburial in home communities where requested.<!-- page 316 --></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>As Commissioners, we have been honoured to bear witness to commemoration ceremonies held by communities to remember and honour children who died in the residential schools.<!-- page 316 -->
Such ceremonies have played an important role in the reconciliation process.<!-- page 316 -->
At the Alberta National Event, the board members of the Remembering the Children Society offered an expression of reconciliation.<!-- page 316 -->
They spoke about the process they undertook to identify children who had died while attending the Red Deer Industrial School.<!-- page 316 -->
Richard Lightning said,<!-- page 316 --></p>
<p>My father, Albert Lightning, and his younger brother, David, from Samson First Nation, went to the Red Deer Industrial School, which was operated by the Methodist Church from 1893 to 1919.<!-- page 317 -->
Albert Lightning survived this school experience, but David died of Spanish flu in 1918.<!-- page 317 -->
In 1986, Albert visited the Red Deer and District Museum and Archives, saying to the staff person, Lyle Keewatin-Richards, “Oh, there you are.<!-- page 317 -->
You’re the one who is going to find my little brother.”<!-- page 317 -->
Lyle learned that along with three other students who had died at the same time, David was buried in the Red Deer City Cemetery.<!-- page 317 -->
Lyle also became aware of the existence of the school cemetery beside Sylvan Creek.<!-- page 317 --></p>
<p>Rev. Cecile Fausak164 explained,<!-- page 317 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Around 2004 …<!-- page 317 -->
people at Sunnybrook United Church began to ask themselves, “Is there anything we can do to build better relations with First Nations peoples in this area?”<!-- page 317 -->
And Lyle, remembering back, suggested then, “There is this little project.<!-- page 317 -->
The children who were buried at the long-neglected [residential] school cemetery and in this city need to be remembered.”<!-- page 317 -->
So the church formed a committee …<!-- page 317 -->
and over the next few years, we researched the site and the school records, personally visited the seven Cree and Stony communities and the Métis nation from which all the students had come.<!-- page 317 -->
In September 2009, over thirty people from those concerned First Nations and Métis communities travelled to Red Deer, had stew and bannock at Sunnybrook United Church, and visited the school cemetery for the first time, where we were welcomed by the [current] landowner.<!-- page 317 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Muriel Stanley Venne, from the Sunnybrook United Church, continued,<!-- page 317 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A working group was formed to organize the first [commemoration] feast, which was held at Fort Normandeau, on June 30, 2010.<!-- page 317 -->
As the more than 325 names of students were read, a hush fell over the crowd…<!-- page 317 -->
Since then the collaboration [has] continued, with First Nations Treaty 6 and 7, Métis Nation of Alberta, United Church members, the Red Deer Museum and Art Gallery, the City and County [of Red Deer], the [Indian] Friendship Centre, and school boards.<!-- page 317 -->
This led to the formation of the Remembering the Children Society in 2011…<!-- page 317 -->
Our society’s objectives include: continued support for recovering Indian residential school cemeteries and histories in Alberta; educating the public about the same; honouring the Survivors, and those who died in the schools; as well as identifying the unmarked graves.<!-- page 317 -->
Each year for the next three years, a commemorative feast was held.<!-- page 317 -->
At the third gathering, many descendants shared stories of the impact on them, their parents, and grandparents, because they attended the Red Deer Industrial School.<!-- page 317 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Charles Wood then said,<!-- page 317 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Society has worked with the museum in developing a new standing exhibit and with the Waskasoo Park administration in the preparation of new interpretive signage at Fort Normandeau regarding the school history.<!-- page 317 -->
We are grateful for the truth spoken of a painful shared history, the friendships we have formed, and the healing that has happened as a result of working together for over five years.<!-- page 317 --><!-- page 318 -->
We will continue to remember the children of the past and present.<!-- page 318 -->
In the Bentwood Box, as symbols of our work together, we place a program of the first ceremony, a dvd from the museum display, flower and ribbon pins from the third feast, and a copy of guidelines we have published of our experience, for those who wish to undertake a similar recovery of a residential school cemetery.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^165</a><!-- page 318 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the most part, the residential school cemeteries and burial sites that the Commission documented are abandoned, disused, and vulnerable to disturbance.<!-- page 318 -->
While there have been community commemoration measures undertaken in some locations, there is an overall need for a national strategy for the documentation, maintenance, commemoration, and protection of residential school cemeteries.<!-- page 318 -->
This work is complex and sensitive.<!-- page 318 -->
Although former schools might be associated with specific Aboriginal communities, the cemeteries may contain the bodies of children from many communities.<!-- page 318 -->
They may also contain the bodies of teachers (or their children) who died while working at the institutions.<!-- page 318 -->
No one set of recommendations will serve all circumstances.<!-- page 318 --></p>

<ol>
<li>We call upon the federal government to work with provincial, territorial, and municipal governments, churches, Aboriginal communities, former residential school students, and current landowners to develop and implement strategies and procedures for the ongoing identification, documentation, maintenance, commemoration, and protection of residential school cemeteries or other sites at which residential school children were buried.<!-- page 318 -->
This is to include the provision of appropriate memorial ceremonies and commemorative markers to honour the deceased children.<!-- page 318 --></li>
</ol>
<p>As infrastructure and resource development accelerates throughout Canada, the risk of damage to undocumented residential school cemeteries increases.<!-- page 318 -->
Depending on the jurisdiction, environmental impact assessments, which include the assessment of heritage sites, are usually required prior to development.<!-- page 318 -->
This generally involves a review of existing documentation, evaluation of the potential for heritage sites within the development zone, and also often a physical search.<!-- page 318 -->
Such work is often done in phases, with preliminary review of centralized archives and databases to inform subsequent investigation.<!-- page 318 -->
Local knowledge about residential cemeteries might not be readily accessible to non-local planners, resource managers, and impact assessors.<!-- page 318 -->
Therefore, it is important that locally collected information is shared with agencies responsible for land-use planning, environmental impact assessment, and protection and regulation of cemeteries.<!-- page 318 --></p>
<p>Such information sharing is hindered by limited documentation, unclear jurisdictional responsibility, and uncoordinated consolidation of information.<!-- page 318 -->
These problems could be addressed through the establishment of a registry of residential school cemeteries that could be available online.<!-- page 318 -->
At a minimum, such a registry should include the identification, duration, and affiliation of each cemetery; its legal description; current land ownership and condition; and its location coordinates.<!-- page 318 --><!-- page 319 --></p>
<p>The complex and sensitive work of documenting, maintaining, commemorating, and protecting residential school cemeteries must be undertaken according to a set of guiding principles that are based on community priorities and knowledge.<!-- page 319 -->
Any physical investigation of the cemeteries must involve close consultation with interested communities, with identification of community-driven objectives, suitable methodologies, and attention to spiritual and emotional sensitivities.<!-- page 319 --></p>
<p>The generally sparse written documentation must be combined with locally held knowledge.<!-- page 319 -->
Often, this information will be unwritten, and held by Survivors, the families of Survivors, staff, or local residents.<!-- page 319 -->
This locally held information can be used to verify, correct, and amplify archival information.<!-- page 319 -->
This work might involve local initiatives to physically document a cemetery’s extent and location, and also to identify individual graves within or around the cemetery area.<!-- page 319 -->
When undertaking physical inspection and documentation of the cemeteries, the most cost-effective strategy involves collection and consolidation of both documentary and locally held knowledge prior to initiating fieldwork.<!-- page 319 -->
This will improve efficiency of the physical search, and aid selection of the most effective field methodologies.<!-- page 319 -->
It also enables researchers to determine community wishes regarding the most appropriate approaches to site investigation.<!-- page 319 -->
This includes preferred protocols regarding prayers and ceremonial observance prior to a site visit.<!-- page 319 --></p>

<p>The Commission believes that assisting families to learn the fate of children who died in residential schools; locating unmarked graves; and maintaining, protecting, and commemorating residential school cemeteries are vital to healing and reconciliation.<!-- page 319 -->
Archives and government departments and agencies have a crucial role to play in this process.<!-- page 319 -->
Equally important, archival records can help Survivors, their families, and communities to reconstruct their family and community histories.<!-- page 319 -->
Yet, accessing such holdings is not without problems.<!-- page 319 --></p>
</section></section><section class="section3" id="the-limitations-of-archives"><h3><a class="toclink" href="#the-limitations-of-archives">The limitations of archives<!-- page 320 --></a></h3>
<p>We have outlined how Library and Archives Canada has dealt with its residential school records.<!-- page 320 -->
Other records that are relevant to the history and legacy of the residential school system are scattered across the country in provincial, territorial, municipal, and local archives, as well as in government departments and agencies that were not parties to the Settlement Agreement.<!-- page 320 -->
All this has made it extremely difficult for Survivors, their families, and communities to access the very records that hold such critical pieces of information about their own lives and the history of their communities.<!-- page 320 --></p>
<p>The Settlement Agreement church archives, to varying degrees, have endeavoured to make their residential school records more accessible to Survivors, their families and communities, researchers, and the general public.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^166</a><!-- page 320 -->
For example, the United Church of Canada has made all its residential school photographs and school histories available online to make them more accessible to Survivors and others, and “as a form of repatriation to First Nations communities.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^167</a><!-- page 320 --></p>
</section><section class="section3" id="the-national-centre-for-truth-and-reconciliation-an-emerging-model"><h3><a class="toclink" href="#the-national-centre-for-truth-and-reconciliation-an-emerging-model">The National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation: An emerging model<!-- page 320 --></a></h3>
<p>Archives may be viewed with distrust by First Nations, Inuit, and Métis peoples.<!-- page 320 -->
Many feel that much of their lives is contained in documents (most of which they have never seen) kept by the state in order to study and categorize them in a depersonalized way.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^168</a><!-- page 320 -->
In various ways, existing archives have been ill suited to serve the needs of Survivors, their families, and communities.<!-- page 320 -->
What Aboriginal peoples required was a centre of their own—a cultural space that would serve as both an archives and a museum to hold the collective memory of Survivors and others whose lives were touched by the history and legacy of the residential school system.<!-- page 320 --></p>
<p>With this understanding, the TRC mandate called for the establishment of a new National Research Centre (nrc) to hold all the historical and newly created documents and oral statements related to residential schools, and to make them accessible for the future.<!-- page 320 -->
This nrc, as created by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada, and now renamed the National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation (NCTR), is an evolving, Survivor-centred model of education for reconciliation.<!-- page 320 -->
Implementing a new approach to public education, research, and record keeping, the centre will serve as a public memory “site of conscience,” bearing permanent witness to Survivors’ testimonies and the history and legacy of the residential school system.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^169</a><!-- page 320 -->
Along with other museums and archives across the country, the centre will shape how the residential school era is understood and remembered.<!-- page 320 --></p>
<p>The concept of the National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation has deep roots.<!-- page 320 -->
For many years, Survivors and their supporters called for a centre that would be their lasting legacy to their own history and to Canada’s national memory.<!-- page 320 --><!-- page 321 -->
In March 2011, the TRC hosted an international forum in Vancouver, “Sharing Truth: Creating a National Research Centre on Residential Schools,” to study how records and other materials from truth and reconciliation commissions around the world have been archived.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^170</a><!-- page 321 -->
Several speakers talked about their vision for the NCTR.<!-- page 321 -->
Georges Erasmus, former co-chair of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples, and then president of the Aboriginal Healing Foundation, said,<!-- page 321 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Those who become the keepers of the archives become stewards of human stories and relationships, of what has been an endowment to what will be.<!-- page 321 -->
Because no legacy is enriched by counterfeit; a nation is ill served by a history which is not genuine.<!-- page 321 -->
This is a high calling indeed and it must be said that too often the promise and the potential of this stewardship has gone unrealized…<!-- page 321 -->
If the stories of our people are not accessible to the general public, it will be as if their experiences never occurred.<!-- page 321 -->
And if their voices are rendered as museum pieces, it will be as if their experience is frozen in time.<!-- page 321 -->
What we need are open, dynamic, interactive spaces and participatory forms of narrative, knowledge, and research.<!-- page 321 -->
This would be a fitting way to step into the twenty-first century and into a new kind of relationship…<!-- page 321 -->
The National Research Centre ought to be a treasure valued by all sorts of people.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^171</a><!-- page 321 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Commission subsequently issued an open invitation for organizations to submit proposals for the NCTR, based on specific criteria.<!-- page 321 -->
In June 2013, the TRC announced that the University of Manitoba would house the new centre.<!-- page 321 --></p>
<p>The National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation will play a key educational role in ensuring that historic harms, and Treaty, constitutional, and human rights violations, against Aboriginal peoples are not repeated.<!-- page 321 -->
As a highly visible site of conscience, it will serve as an intervention in the country’s public memory and national history.<!-- page 321 -->
The centre is independent from government.<!-- page 321 -->
It is guided by a Governing Circle, the majority of whose members must be Aboriginal and which includes Survivor representatives.<!-- page 321 -->
Among its various responsibilities, this governing body will make decisions and provide advice on ceremonies and protocols, and establish a Survivors’ Circle.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^172</a><!-- page 321 --></p>
<p>The centre will house TRC records, including Survivors’ oral history statements, artworks, expressions of reconciliation, and other materials gathered by the Commission, as well as government and church documents.<!-- page 321 -->
It is intended to be a welcoming and safe place for Survivors, their families, and communities to have access to their own history.<!-- page 321 -->
The centre has committed to creating a culturally rooted and healing environment where all Canadians can honour, learn from, and commemorate the history and legacy of the residential schools.<!-- page 321 --></p>
<p>Once the centre is fully operational, it will be well positioned to take a leadership role in forging new directions in residential school- and Indigenous rights-based research, establishing new standards and benchmarks for archival and museum policy, management, and operations, based on Indigenous and Western principles and best practices.<!-- page 321 --></p>
<p>The University of Manitoba and its partners<a href="footnote-placeholder">^173</a> have emphasized that the centre recognizes the<!-- page 322 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>paramount importance of accessibility [for] the Aboriginal survivor, family member [or]researcher, [and is] committed to recognition of Aboriginal peoples as co-creators of the IRS records, through co-curation and participatory archiving; and committed to continuing the work of the TRC of statement-gathering, public education, engagement and outreach.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^174</a><!-- page 322 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The NCTR will incorporate an<!-- page 322 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>archival system and approach which is devoted to “reconciling records”; [it] will …<!-- page 322 -->
support Indigenous frameworks of knowledge, memory and evidence, and reposition …<!-- page 322 -->
Indigenous communities as co-creators of archival records that relate to them, including government archives.<!-- page 322 -->
Such approaches acknowledge rights in records that extend beyond access to working in partnership with archival institutions to manage appraisal, description and accessibility of records relating to Indigenous communities.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^175</a><!-- page 322 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The centre is committed to “establish[ing] trust with Aboriginal communities by working with these communities to realize their own goals through participatory archiving…<!-- page 322 -->
The process of participatory archiving, interacting with as complete a record as possible, will be a powerful force for reconciliation and healing.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^176</a><!-- page 322 -->
As well, the Centre for Truth and Reconciliation is also committed to<!-- page 322 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>personally supporting survivors, their families, and all researchers in navigating, using, and understanding the records, in a culturally sensitive environment.<!-- page 322 -->
The support that the nrc will provide includes emotionally-sensitive support, acknowledging that accessing the nrc documents may be traumatic, difficult or otherwise emotional experiences for many users.<!-- page 322 -->
An Elder will be present or on call (from a nearby building) most of the time the nrc is open to the public.<!-- page 322 -->
LAC and other government departments have no mandate or capacity to offer these various supports, which are critical to relationship-building and overcoming the perception of archives as yet another mechanism of colonization, cultural appropriation by Western society and hyper-surveillance and objectification of Aboriginal peoples.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^177</a><!-- page 322 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>On June 21, 2013, First Nations, Inuit, and Métis Survivors, Elders, the TRC, the University of Manitoba and its partner institutions, along with other dignitaries, gathered in Treaty 1 territory of the Anishinaabe peoples and homeland of the Métis Nation for a signing ceremony at the University of Manitoba.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^178</a><!-- page 322 -->
The signing of a Trust Deed with the university marks the transfer of a sacred trust—a solemn promise that the Truth and Reconciliation Commission made to Survivors and all those affected by the residential schools as it travelled across the country, bearing witness to their testimonies.<!-- page 322 --></p>
<p>The NCTR is committed to making all its holdings readily accessible to Survivors, their families, and communities, as well as to the public, educators, and researchers.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^179</a> To support reconciliation at the local level, the Commission believes, it will be especially important to ensure that communities are able to access the centre’s holdings and resources in order to produce histories of their own residential school experiences and their involvement in the truth, healing, and reconciliation process.<!-- page 322 --><!-- page 323 --></p>
<p>The centre will be a living legacy, a teaching and learning place for public education to promote understanding and reconciliation through ongoing statement gathering, new research, commemoration ceremonies, dialogues on reconciliation, and celebrations of Indigenous cultures, oral histories, and legal traditions.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^180</a><!-- page 323 --></p>

<p>For Survivors who came forward at the TRC’s National Events and Community Hearings, remembering their childhood often meant reliving horrific memories of abuse, hunger, and neglect.<!-- page 323 -->
It meant dredging up painful feelings of loneliness, abandonment, and shame.<!-- page 323 -->
Many still struggle to heal deep wounds of the past.<!-- page 323 -->
Words fail to do justice to their courage in standing up and speaking out.<!-- page 323 --></p>
<p>There were other memories too: of resilience; of lifetime friendships forged with classmates and teachers; of taking pride in art, music, or sports accomplishments; of becoming leaders in their communities and in the life of the nation.<!-- page 323 -->
Survivors shared their memories with Canada and the world so that the truth could no longer be denied.<!-- page 323 -->
Survivors also remembered so that other Canadians could learn from these hard lessons of the past.<!-- page 323 -->
They want Canadians to know, to remember, to care, and to change.<!-- page 323 --></p>
<p>One of the most significant harms to come out of the residential schools was the attack on Indigenous memory.<!-- page 323 -->
The federal government’s policy of assimilation sought to break the chain of memory that connected the hearts, minds, and spirits of Aboriginal children to their families, communities, and nations.<!-- page 323 -->
Many, but not all, Survivors have found ways to restore those connections.<!-- page 323 --><!-- page 324 -->
They believe that reconciliation with other Canadians calls for changing the country’s collective, national history so that it is based on the truth about what happened to them as children, and to their families, communities, and nations.<!-- page 324 --></p>
<p>Public memory is important.<!-- page 324 -->
It is especially important to recognize that the transmission of that collective memory from generation to generation of First Nations, Inuit, and Métis individuals, families, and communities was impaired by the actions of those who ran residential schools.<!-- page 324 --></p>
<p>As Commissioners, we are governed in our approach to reconciliation with this thought: the way that we all have been educated in this country—Aboriginal children in residential schools and Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal children in public and other schools—has brought us to where we are today: to a point where the psychological and emotional well-being of Aboriginal children has been harmed, and the relationship between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal peoples has been seriously damaged.<!-- page 324 -->
We believe that true reconciliation can take place only through a reshaping of a shared, national, collective memory: our understanding of who we are and what has come before.<!-- page 324 -->
The youth of this country are taking up this challenge.<!-- page 324 --></p>
<p>At the Alberta National Event in March 2014, Jessica Bolduc, an Indigenous youth representing the 4Rs Youth Movement, a national consortium of Indigenous and non-Indigenous youth-representing organizations, said:<!-- page 324 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>We have re-examined our thoughts and beliefs around colonialism, and have made a commitment to unpack our own baggage, and to enter into a new relationship with each other, using this momentum, to move our country forward, in light of the 150th anniversary of the Confederation of Canada in 2017.<!-- page 324 --></p>
<p>At this point in time, we ask ourselves, “What does that anniversary mean for us, as Indigenous youth and non-Indigenous youth, and how do we arrive at that day with something we can celebrate together?”…<!-- page 324 -->
Our hope is that, one day, we will live together, as recognized nations, within a country we can all be proud of.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^181</a><!-- page 324 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reshaping national history is a public process, one that happens through discussion, sharing, and commemoration.<!-- page 324 -->
As Canadians gather in public spaces to share their memories, beliefs, and ideas about the past with others, our collective understanding of the present and future is formed.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^182</a><!-- page 324 -->
As citizens, our ideas, world views, cultural identities, and values are shaped not only in classrooms and museums or by popular culture, but also in everyday social relationships and patterns of living that become our way of life.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^183</a><!-- page 324 --></p>
<p>Public memory is dynamic—it changes over time as new understandings, dialogues, artistic expressions, and commemorations emerge.<!-- page 324 -->
Public memory, much like national history, is often contentious.<!-- page 324 -->
Although public memory can simply reinforce the colonial story of how Canada began with European settlement and became a nation, the process of remembering the past together also invites people to question this limited version of history.<!-- page 324 --></p>
<p>Unlike some truth and reconciliation commissions that have focused on individual victims of human rights violations committed over a short period of time, this Commission has examined both the individual and collective harms perpetrated against Aboriginal families, communities, and nations for well over a century, as well as the preconditions that enabled such violence and oppression to occur.<!-- page 325 -->
Of course, previously inaccessible archival documents are critically important to correcting the historical record, but we have given equal weight and greater voice to Indigenous oral-based history, legal traditions, and memory practices in our work and in this final report, since these represent the previously unheard and unrecorded versions of history, knowledge, and wisdom.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^184</a><!-- page 325 -->
This has significantly informed our thinking about why repairing and revitalizing individual, family, and community memory are so crucial to the truth and reconciliation process.<!-- page 325 --></p>
<section class="section3" id="dialogue-ceremony-testimony-and-witnessing"><h3><a class="toclink" href="#dialogue-ceremony-testimony-and-witnessing">Dialogue: Ceremony, testimony, and witnessing<!-- page 325 --></a></h3>
<p>Just as Survivors were involved in the long struggle to achieve a legally binding Settlement Agreement for the harms they have experienced, and an official apology, they have also continued to advise the Commission as it has implemented its mandate.<!-- page 325 -->
Guided by Elders, Knowledge Keepers, and the members of the TRC Survivor Committee, the Commission has made Aboriginal oral history, legal traditions, and memory practices—ceremony, protocols, and the rituals of storytelling and testimonial witnessing— central to the TRC’s National Events, Community Hearings, forums, and dialogues.<!-- page 325 -->
The Commission’s proceedings themselves constitute an oral history record, duly witnessed by all those in attendance.<!-- page 325 -->
Working with local communities in each region, sacred ceremonies and protocols were performed and followed at all TRC events.<!-- page 325 -->
Elders and traditional healers ensured that a safe environment was created for truth sharing, apology, healing, and acts of reconciliation.<!-- page 325 --></p>
</section><section class="section3" id="the-power-of-ceremony"><h3><a class="toclink" href="#the-power-of-ceremony">The power of ceremony<!-- page 325 --></a></h3>
<p>Sacred ceremony has always been at the heart of Indigenous cultures, law, and political life.<!-- page 325 -->
When ceremonies were outlawed by the federal government, they were hidden away until the law was repealed.<!-- page 325 -->
Historically and, to a certain degree, even at present, Indigenous ceremonies that create community bonds, sanctify laws, and ratify Treaty making have been misunderstood, disrespected, and disregarded by Canada.<!-- page 325 -->
These ceremonies must now be recognized and honoured as an integral, vital, ongoing dimension of the truth and reconciliation process.<!-- page 325 --></p>
<p>Ceremonies also reach across cultures to bridge the divide between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal peoples.<!-- page 325 -->
They are vital to reconciliation because of their sacred nature and because they connect people, preparing them to listen respectfully to each other in a difficult dialogue.<!-- page 325 --><!-- page 326 -->
Ceremonies are an affirmation of human dignity; they feed our spirits and comfort us even as they call on us to reimagine or envision finding common ground.<!-- page 326 -->
Ceremonies validate and legitimize Treaties, family and kinship lines, and connections to the land.<!-- page 326 -->
Ceremonies are also acts of memory sharing, mourning, healing, and renewal; they express the collective memory of families, communities, and nations.<!-- page 326 --></p>
<p>Ceremonies enable us to set aside, however briefly, our cynicism, doubts, and disbelief, even as they console us, educate us, and inspire hope.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^185</a><!-- page 326 -->
They have an intangible quality that moves us from our heads to our hearts.<!-- page 326 -->
They teach us about ourselves, our histories, and our lives.<!-- page 326 -->
Ceremony and ritual have played an important role in various conflict and peace-building settings across the globe, including North America, where Indigenous nations have their own long histories of diplomacy and peacemaking.<!-- page 326 -->
Ceremonial rituals have three functions in the peacemaking process.<!-- page 326 -->
First, they create a safe space for people to interact and learn as they take part in the ceremony.<!-- page 326 -->
Second, they enable people to communicate non-verbally and process their emotions.<!-- page 326 -->
Third, ceremonies create an environment where change is made possible; world views, identities, and relationships with others are transformed.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^186</a><!-- page 326 --></p>
<p>Those in attendance at TRC events learned to acknowledge and respect Indigenous ceremonies and protocols by participating in them.<!-- page 326 -->
The Commission intentionally made ceremonies the spiritual and ethical framework of our public education work, creating a safe space for sharing life stories and bearing testimonial witness to the past for the future.<!-- page 326 --></p>
<p>The Commission’s National Events were designed to inspire reconciliation and shape individual and collective memory by demonstrating the core values that lie at the heart of reconciliation: respect, courage, love, truth, humility, honesty, and wisdom.<!-- page 326 -->
These values are known by many Aboriginal peoples as the “Seven Sacred Teachings.”<!-- page 326 -->
They are also in the ancient teachings of most world religions.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^187</a><!-- page 326 -->
Each National Event focused on one of these teachings.<!-- page 326 -->
Working closely with local Aboriginal communities and various regional organizations, representatives of the parties to the Settlement Agreement, and other government and community networks, the Commission took great care to ensure that the proper ceremonies and protocols were understood and followed throughout every National Event.<!-- page 326 -->
Elders offered prayers and teachings at the opening and closing of each event.<!-- page 326 -->
Smudges, sacred pipe and water ceremonies, cedar brushings, songs, and drumming occurred on a regular basis throughout.<!-- page 326 -->
At each event, a sacred fire was lit and cared for by Elders and Fire Keepers.<!-- page 326 -->
Water ceremonies were performed by the women who were recognized as the Protectors of the Waters.<!-- page 326 -->
The sacred fire was also used for ongoing prayers and tobacco offerings, as well as to receive the tissues from the many tears shed during each event.<!-- page 326 -->
The ashes from each of the sacred fires were then carried forward to the next National Event, to be added in turn to its sacred fire, thus gathering in sacred ceremony the tears of an entire country.<!-- page 326 --></p>
<p>The Commission’s mandate also instructed that there be a “ceremonial transfer of knowledge” at the National Events.<!-- page 327 -->
Coast Salish artist Luke Marston was commissioned by the TRC to design and carve a Bentwood Box as a symbol of this transfer.<!-- page 327 -->
The box was steamed and bent in the traditional way from a single piece of west-coast red cedar.<!-- page 327 -->
Its intricately carved and beautifully painted wood panels represent First Nations, Inuit, and Métis cultures.<!-- page 327 -->
The Bentwood Box is a lasting tribute to all residential school Survivors and their families, both those who are living and those who have passed on, including the artist’s grandmother, who attended Kuper Island residential school.<!-- page 327 -->
This ceremonial box travelled with the Commission to every one of its seven National Events, where offerings—public expressions of reconciliation—were made by governments, churches and other faith communities, educational institutions, the business sector, municipalities, youth groups, and various other groups and organizations.<!-- page 327 -->
The Truth and Reconciliation Bentwood Box, along with the many other sacred items the TRC received, will be housed permanently in the National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^188</a><!-- page 327 --></p>
</section><section class="section3" id="life-stories-testimonies-and-witnessing-as-teachings"><h3><a class="toclink" href="#life-stories-testimonies-and-witnessing-as-teachings">Life stories, testimonies, and witnessing as teachings<!-- page 327 --></a></h3>
<p>Reconciliation is not possible without knowing the truth.<!-- page 327 -->
In order to determine the truth and be able to tell the full and complete story of residential schools in this country, it was fundamentally important to the Commission’s work to be able to hear the stories of Survivors and their families.<!-- page 327 -->
It was also important to hear the stories of those who worked in the schools—the teachers, the administrators, the cooks, the janitors—as well as their family members.<!-- page 327 -->
Canada’s national history must reflect this complex truth so that 50 or 100 years from now, our children’s children and their children will know what happened.<!-- page 327 -->
They will inherit the responsibility of ensuring that it never happens again.<!-- page 327 --></p>
<p>Regardless of the different individual experiences that children had as students in the schools, they shared the common experience of being exploited.<!-- page 327 -->
They were victims of a system intent on destroying intergenerational links of memory to their families, communities, and nations.<!-- page 327 -->
The process of assimilation also profoundly disrespected parents, grandparents, and Elders in their rightful roles as the carriers of memory, through which culture, language, and identity are transmitted from one generation to the next.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^189</a><!-- page 327 --></p>
<p>In providing their testimonies to the TRC, Survivors reclaimed their rightful place as members of intergenerational communities of memory.<!-- page 327 -->
They remembered so that their families could understand what happened.<!-- page 327 -->
They remembered so that their cultures, histories, laws, and nations can once again thrive for the benefit of future generations.<!-- page 327 -->
They remembered so that Canada will know the truth and never forget.<!-- page 327 --></p>
<p>The residential school story is complicated.<!-- page 327 -->
Stories of abuse stand in sharp contradiction to the happier memories of some Survivors.<!-- page 327 -->
The statements of former residential school staff also varied.<!-- page 327 --><!-- page 328 -->
Some were remorseful while others were defensive.<!-- page 328 -->
Some were proud of their students and their own efforts to support them while others were critical of their own school and government authorities for their lack of attention, care, and resources.<!-- page 328 -->
The stories of government and church officials involved acknowledgement, apology, and promises not to repeat history.<!-- page 328 -->
Some non-Aboriginal Canadians expressed outrage at what had happened in the schools and shared their feelings of guilt and shame that they had not known this.<!-- page 328 -->
Others denied or minimized the destructive impacts of residential schools.<!-- page 328 -->
These conflicting stories, based on different experiences, locations, time periods, and perspectives, all feed into a national historical narrative.<!-- page 328 --></p>
<p>Developing this narrative through public dialogue can strengthen civic capacity for accountability and so do justice to victims, not just in the legal sense, but also in terms of restoring human dignity, nurturing mutual respect, and supporting healing.<!-- page 328 -->
As citizens use ceremony and testimony to remember, witness, and commemorate, they learn how to put the principles of accountability, justice, and reconciliation into everyday practice.<!-- page 328 -->
They become active agents in the truth and reconciliation process.<!-- page 328 --></p>
<p>Participants at Commission events learned from the Survivors themselves by interacting directly with them.<!-- page 328 -->
Survivors, whose memories are still alive, demonstrated in the most powerful and compelling terms that by sitting together in Sharing Circles, people gain a much deeper knowledge and understanding of what happened in the residential schools than can ever be acquired at a distance by studying books, reading newspapers, or watching television reports.<!-- page 328 --></p>
<p>For Indigenous peoples, stories and teachings are rooted in relationships.<!-- page 328 -->
Through stories, knowledge and understanding about what happened and why are acquired, validated, and shared with others.<!-- page 328 -->
Writing about her work with Survivors from her own community, social work scholar Qwul’sih’yah’maht (Robina Anne Thomas) said,<!-- page 328 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I never dreamed of learning to listen in such a powerful way.<!-- page 328 -->
Storytelling, despite all the struggles, enabled me to respect and honour the Ancestors and the storytellers while at the same time sharing tragic, traumatic, inhumanely unbelievable truths that our people had lived.<!-- page 328 -->
It was this level of integrity that was essential to storytelling…<!-- page 328 -->
When we make personal what we teach …<!-- page 328 -->
we touch people in a different and more profound way.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^190</a><!-- page 328 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>At a Community Hearing in St.<!-- page 328 -->
Paul, Alberta, in January 2011, Charles Cardinal explained that although he did not want to remember his residential school experiences, he came forward because “we’ve got to let other people hear our voices.”<!-- page 328 -->
When he was asked how, given the history of the residential schools, Canada could be a better place, he replied that we must “listen to the people.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^191</a><!-- page 328 -->
When asked the same question in Beausejour, Manitoba, Laurie McDonald said that Canada must begin by “doing exactly what is happening now …<!-- page 328 -->
governments …<!-- page 328 -->
[have got to know] that they can never, ever, ever do this again.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^192</a><!-- page 328 -->
In Ottawa, Survivor Victoria Grant-Boucher said,<!-- page 328 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m telling my story …<!-- page 329 -->
for the education of the Canadian general public …<!-- page 329 -->
[so that they] can understand what stolen identity is, you know, how it affects people, how it affects an individual, how it affects family, how it affects community…<!-- page 329 -->
I think the non-Aboriginal person, Canadian, has to understand that a First Nations person has a culture…<!-- page 329 -->
And I think that we, as Aboriginal people, have so much to share if you just let us regain that knowledge…<!-- page 329 -->
And I also take to heart what Elders talk about …<!-- page 329 -->
we have to heal ourselves.<!-- page 329 -->
We have to heal each other.<!-- page 329 -->
And for Canada to heal, they have to allow us to heal before we can contribute.<!-- page 329 -->
That’s what reconciliation means to me.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^193</a><!-- page 329 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Survivors told the Commission that an important reason for breaking their silence was to educate their own children and grandchildren by publicly sharing their life stories with them.<!-- page 329 -->
The effect of this on intergenerational Survivors was significant.<!-- page 329 -->
At the Manitoba National Event, Desarae Eashappie said,<!-- page 329 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have sat through this week having the honour of listening to the stories from Survivors.<!-- page 329 -->
And I just feel—I just really want to acknowledge everybody in this room, you know, all of our Elders, all of our Survivors, all of our intergenerational Survivors…<!-- page 329 -->
We are all sitting here in solidarity right now …<!-- page 329 -->
and we are all on our own journey, and [yet we are] sitting here together …<!-- page 329 -->
with so much strength in this room, it really is phenomenal.<!-- page 329 -->
And I just want to acknowledge that and thank everybody here.<!-- page 329 -->
And to be given this experience, this opportunity, you know, to sit here …<!-- page 329 -->
and to listen to other people and listen to their stories and their experiences, you know, it has really humbled me as a person in such a way that is indescribable…<!-- page 329 -->
And I can take this home with me now and I can take it into my own home.<!-- page 329 -->
Because my dad is a residential school Survivor, I have lived the traumas, but I have lived the history without the context.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^194</a><!-- page 329 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Survivors’ life stories are teachings rooted in personal experience; the human relationships of their childhoods were scarred by those who harmed them in the schools.<!-- page 329 -->
Their stories teach us about what it means to lose family, culture, community, self-esteem, and human dignity.<!-- page 329 -->
They also teach us about courage, resilience, and resistance to violence and oppression.<!-- page 329 -->
An ethical response to Survivors’ life stories requires the listener to respond in ways that recognize the teller’s dignity and affirm that injustices were committed.<!-- page 329 -->
NonIndigenous witnesses must be willing to “risk interacting differently with Indigenous people—with vulnerability, humility, and a willingness to stay in the decolonizing struggle of our own discomfort …<!-- page 329 -->
[and] to embrace [residential school] stories as powerful teachings—disquieting moments [that] can change our beliefs, attitudes, and actions.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^195</a><!-- page 329 --></p>
<p>A number of former residential school staff came to the Commission to speak not only about their perspectives on the time they spent at the schools, but also about their struggles to come to terms with their own past.<!-- page 329 -->
Florence Kaefer, a former teacher, spoke at the Manitoba National Event.<!-- page 329 --></p>
<p>And from my English ancestors, I apologize today for what my people did to you.<!-- page 330 -->
I taught in two residential schools.<!-- page 330 -->
In 1954, I taught in Norway House United Church Residential School for three or four years, and then I taught in the Alberni United Church Indian Residential School in bc.<!-- page 330 -->
I worked very hard to be the best teacher I could be, and I did not know about the violence and cruelty going on in the dormitories and in the playrooms.<!-- page 330 -->
But I have found out through one of my former students, who was five years old when he came to Norway House, his name is Edward Gamblin, and Edward Gamblin and I have gone through a personal truth and reconciliation.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^196</a><!-- page 330 --></p>
<p>In a media interview afterwards, Ms Kaefer said that she contacted Mr.<!-- page 330 -->
Gamblin after<!-- page 330 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>hearing his song a few years ago describing the cultural, physical and sexual abuse he had suffered at Norway House school.<!-- page 330 -->
She said, “I just cried.<!-- page 330 -->
I told my sister that I can never think of teaching in the residential school in the same way again.”<!-- page 330 -->
She called Gamblin after hearing the song.<!-- page 330 -->
He told her he had to hide his abuse from the good teachers for fear he would lose them if they found out what was happening and left.<!-- page 330 -->
He invited Kaefer to a healing circle in 2006 and they became close friends.<!-- page 330 -->
Kaefer said Gamblin taught her not to be embarrassed about her past, being part of a school where abuse took place.<!-- page 330 -->
“I was 19 and you don’t question your church and your government when you’re 19, but I certainly question my church and my government today.”<!-- page 330 -->
…<!-- page 330 -->
Gamblin said Kaefer taught him how to forgive.<!-- page 330 -->
“There are good people [teachers] who don’t deserve to be labeled,” he said.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^197</a><!-- page 330 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some family members of former staff also came forward.<!-- page 330 -->
At the Manitoba National Event, Jack Lee told the Commission,<!-- page 330 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>My parents were staff members of the Indian residential school in Norway House.<!-- page 330 -->
I was born on a reserve in Ontario and I moved with my family to Norway House when I was about one or two years old, and started school in the Indian residential school system, basically, at the very start as a day student …<!-- page 330 -->
as a white boy…<!-- page 330 -->
My father agonized very much over his role…<!-- page 330 -->
But I just want everyone to know that my father tried his best, as many other staff members tried their best, but they were working with so limited resources, and many of them felt very bad about their role in it, but they chose to stay in the system because it was still better than nothing, it was still better than abandoning the system, and abandoning the students that were in it.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^198</a><!-- page 330 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the Atlantic National Event, Mark DeWolf spoke to us about his father, the Reverend James Edward DeWolf, who was the principal at two residential schools: St. Paul’s in Alberta and La Tuque in Québec.<!-- page 330 -->
He said,<!-- page 330 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m quite hesitant to speak here this morning …<!-- page 330 -->
I’m not here to defend my father so much, as to speak part of the truth about the kind of person my father was.<!-- page 330 -->
I think he was an exemplary principal of an Indian residential school…<!-- page 330 -->
Part of the story will be about what I saw around me, what my parents tried to do, however effective that was, however well-intentioned that was, however beneficial or not beneficial it was, you will at least when you leave here today, have a bit more of the story and you may judge for yourselves.<!-- page 330 --><!-- page 331 -->

<p>[My father] did so many things, coached the teams, blew the whistle or shot off the starting pistol at the sports days.<!-- page 331 -->
Twelve o’clock at midnight, on the coldest of winter days, he would be out on the rink that he had constructed behind the school, flooding it so that the children could skate.<!-- page 331 -->
He devoted his life to the service of his church, his God, and those that he thought had been marginalized, oppressed…<!-- page 331 -->
It is a terrible shame there were not more like him.<!-- page 331 -->
When we leave today, though, let’s remember that when you have a system like the residential school, there are the individuals within the system, some of whom are good, decent, loving, caring people, and some of whom are blind, intolerant, predatory…<!-- page 331 -->
My father worked within the system trying to make it a better one.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^199</a><!-- page 331 --></p>

<p>The mandate of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission describes “reconciliation” as an ongoing individual and collective process involving all the people of Canada.<!-- page 331 -->
To help ensure that reconciliation will indeed be ongoing, even after the TRC’s own official work is done, the Commissioners decided early on a public education and advocacy strategy to engage high-profile supporters, each willing to foster the continuing work of public education and dialogue.<!-- page 331 -->
We called upon more than seventy of them across the country and internationally, and inducted them as Honorary Witnesses in a public ceremony at each of the National Events.<!-- page 331 -->
Together, they represent accomplished and influential leaders from all walks of life, now serving as ambassadors in educating the broader public about why reconciliation is necessary.<!-- page 331 -->
Most of them, including some who had worked with Aboriginal people in the past, frankly admitted to their own prior gaps in knowledge and understanding of the residential schools system and its continuing legacy.<!-- page 331 -->
They now encourage the broader Canadian public to do what they have done: to learn and to be transformed in understanding and in commitment to societal change.<!-- page 331 --></p>
<p>Speaking at the Saskatchewan National Event, TRC Honorary Witness and a former member of parliament, the Honourable Tina Keeper, who is also a member of the Norway House Cree Nation, talked about the importance of honouring individual, family, and community relationships and memory, her own emotional involvement in the ratification of the Settlement Agreement, and the struggles surrounding Canada’s apology.<!-- page 331 -->
She underscored the strong contributions that Aboriginal peoples have to make to national healing and reconciliation.<!-- page 331 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yesterday was an incredible opportunity for me personally to let the tears flow, and they flowed all day long.<!-- page 331 -->
And I didn’t do that when I was in the House of Commons. &gt; I had the privilege of delivering the speech on behalf of the official opposition when the Agreement was tabled in the House, and during that speech I had to stop midway and breathe …<!-- page 331 --><!-- page 332 -->
because I didn’t think I could do it.<!-- page 332 -->
I kept thinking of my family and my extended family and my grandparents and so many of the people in the communities…<!-- page 332 -->
[O]ur cultures, our languages, our values, and spiritual beliefs that have taken care of us at this gathering …<!-- page 332 -->
they will become tools for the healing of a nation.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^200</a><!-- page 332 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the Québec National Event, TRC Honorary Witness and a former prime minister, the Right Honourable Paul Martin, reminded participants about the role that education played in the attempted destruction of Aboriginal families, communities, and nations, and the role it must play in repairing this damage.<!-- page 332 -->
He said,<!-- page 332 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’ve talked to a number of the people here, some of the members of parliament are here …<!-- page 332 -->
and the question we asked ourselves is, “How come we didn’t know what happened?”<!-- page 332 -->
…<!-- page 332 -->
I still can’t answer that…<!-- page 332 -->
[L]et us understand that what happened at the residential schools was the use of education for cultural genocide …<!-- page 332 -->
[let’s] call a spade a spade.<!-- page 332 -->
What that really means is that we’ve got to offer Aboriginal Canadians, without any shadow of a doubt, the best education system that is possible to have.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^201</a><!-- page 332 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although some Honorary Witnesses already had significant knowledge of Aboriginal issues, including residential schools, through the act of witnessing Survivors’ testimonies, they learned about this history in a different way.<!-- page 332 -->
At the Saskatchewan National Event, a former prime minister, the Right Honourable Joe Clark, said that the Saskatchewan National Event gave him a better understanding of the intergenerational impacts of the residential schools, and a better sense of the challenges and opportunities for reconciliation with the rest of Canada.<!-- page 332 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>When I came to take my place this morning, I knew the storyline, if you will.<!-- page 332 -->
I knew what had happened.<!-- page 332 -->
I had some idea of the consequences it [the residential school system] involved, but I had no real idea because I had not been able to witness it before …<!-- page 332 -->
the multi-generational emotion that is involved in what has happened to so many of the victims of the residential schools…<!-- page 332 -->
[Today] I heard, “We are only as sick as our secrets.”<!-- page 332 -->
That is an incentive to all that have kept these emotions and this history too secret, too long, to show the courage that so many of you have shown, and let those facts be known…<!-- page 332 --></p>
<p>There are cross-cultural difficulties here as we seek reconciliation, the reconciliation of people who have not been part of this experience with those who have.<!-- page 332 -->
We are going to deal with cultural differences, but no one wants to be torn away from their roots.<!-- page 332 -->
And there are common grounds here by which consensus can be built…<!-- page 332 -->
Reconciliation means finding a way that brings together the legitimate concerns of the people in this room, and the apprehensions, call them fear …<!-- page 332 -->
that might exist elsewhere in the country…<!-- page 332 -->
Among the things we have to do is to ensure that not only the stories of abuse as they touch First Nations and Aboriginal people, but also the story of their contribution to Canada, and the values that are inherent in those communities is much better known.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^202</a><!-- page 332 --><!-- page 333 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Joe Clark’s observations reinforce this Commission’s view that learning happens in a different manner when life stories are shared and witnessed in ways that connect knowledge, understanding, and human relationships.<!-- page 333 -->
He pinpointed a key challenge to reconciliation: how to bridge the divides between those who have been part of the residential school experience and those who have not, and between those who have participated in the Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s proceedings and those who have not.<!-- page 333 --></p>
<p>The former minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, the late Honourable Andy Scott, was inducted as an Honorary Witness at the 2012 Atlantic National Event in Halifax.<!-- page 333 -->
He then served to welcome new inductees to the Honorary Witness circle at the Saskatchewan National Event, and to reflect on his experience.<!-- page 333 -->
His comments reinforce the Commission’s conviction that relationship-based learning and ways of remembering lead to a deeper knowledge and understanding of the links between the Survivors’ experiences and community memory and our collective responsibility and need to re-envision Canada’s national history, identity, and future.<!-- page 333 -->
He told us,<!-- page 333 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>When I was invited to become an Honorary Witness, I thought I was prepared, having been involved in the Settlement process and having already met and heard from Survivors.<!-- page 333 -->
I was not.<!-- page 333 -->
In Halifax, I heard about not knowing what it meant to be loved, not knowing how to love.<!-- page 333 -->
I heard about simply wanting to be believed that it happened, ‘just like I said.’ …<!-- page 333 -->
We heard about a deliberate effort to disconnect young children from who they are.<!-- page 333 -->
We heard about a sense of betrayal by authority— government, community, and church.<!-- page 333 -->
We heard about severe punishment for speaking one’s language, living one’s spirituality, seeking out one’s siblings.<!-- page 333 -->
We heard about forced feeding, physical and sexual abuse.<!-- page 333 -->
And we heard about deaths.<!-- page 333 -->
We heard about forgiving as a way to move on and we heard from those who felt that they would never be able to forgive.<!-- page 333 -->
I could not and cannot imagine being taken away to a strange place as a five- or a six-year-old, never knowing why or for how long.<!-- page 333 -->
Perhaps I remember most poignantly Ruth, who said simply, “I never thought I’d talk about this, and now I don’t think I’ll ever stop.<!-- page 333 -->
But Canada is big.<!-- page 333 -->
I’ll need some help.”<!-- page 333 --></p>
<p>Reconciliation is about Survivors speaking about their experiences, being heard and being believed, but it’s also about a national shared history.<!-- page 333 -->
As Canadians, we must be part of reconciling what we have done collectively with who we believe we are.<!-- page 333 -->
To do that with integrity and to restore our honour, we must all know the history so we can reunite these different Canadas.<!-- page 333 -->
203<!-- page 333 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Commission also heard from a variety of other Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal witnesses from many walks of life.<!-- page 333 -->
Some were there on behalf of their institution or organization.<!-- page 333 -->
Some had close personal or professional ties to Aboriginal people, and others had none.<!-- page 333 -->
Many said that the experience opened their eyes and was powerfully transformative.<!-- page 333 -->
They commented on how much they had learned by listening to Survivors’ life stories.<!-- page 333 -->
This was true for both non-Aboriginal witnesses and Aboriginal witnesses whose own families had been impacted by the schools but who may have had few opportunities to learn more about the residential schools themselves, especially in those many families where no one was yet willing or able to talk about it.<!-- page 333 --><!-- page 334 --></p>
<p>At the 2011 Northern National Event in Inuvik, Therese Boullard, then the director of the Northwest Territories Human Rights Commission, told us,<!-- page 334 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>We need to have an accurate record of history…<!-- page 334 -->
As long as there are some that are in denial of what really happened, as long as we don’t have the full picture of what happened, we really can’t move forward in that spirit of reconciliation…<!-- page 334 -->
I want to acknowledge these stories as gifts, a hand towards reconciliation.<!-- page 334 -->
I think it’s amazing that after all that has passed, after all that you’ve experienced, that you would be willing to share your pain with the rest of Canada in this spirit of openness and reconciliation and in this faith that the government of Canada and non-Aboriginal Canadians will receive them in a way that will lead to a better relationship in the future.<!-- page 334 -->
That you have that faith to share your stories in that spirit is amazing and it’s humbling and it’s inspiring and I just want to thank Survivors for that.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^204</a><!-- page 334 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the 2010 Manitoba National Event, Ginelle Giacomin, a high school history teacher from Winnipeg who served as a private statement gatherer at the event, said,<!-- page 334 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I was talking to a few students before I came this week to do this, and they said, “Well, what do you mean there are Survivors?<!-- page 334 -->
That was a long time ago.<!-- page 334 -->
That was hundreds of years ago.”<!-- page 334 -->
To them, this is a page in a history book…<!-- page 334 -->
So, I’m so blessed to have spent the past week sitting down one-on-one with Survivors and listening to their stories.<!-- page 334 -->
And I have heard horrific things and the emotions.<!-- page 334 -->
It’s been very hard to hear.<!-- page 334 -->
But what every single person I’ve spoken to has said is that “we are strong.”<!-- page 334 -->
And the strength is one thing that I’ll carry with me when I leave.<!-- page 334 -->
You carry on, and that’s something that I want to bring back to my classrooms, is the strength of everyone that I spoke to and their stories.<!-- page 334 -->
And it is so important for high school students, and all students in Canada, to be talking about this a lot more than they are.<!-- page 334 -->
I just want to thank everyone involved for doing this, for educating me.<!-- page 334 -->
I have a history degree in Canadian history.<!-- page 334 -->
I learned more in the past five days about Canada than I have in three years of that degree.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^205</a><!-- page 334 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Commission’s seven National Events, by all accounts, provided a respectful space for public dialogue.<!-- page 334 -->
Over 150,000 Canadians came out to participate in them and in some 300 smaller-scale Community Events.<!-- page 334 -->
One of the most common words used in describing them was “transformational.”<!-- page 334 -->
It will be up to others to determine their long-term effectiveness, and to judge this model’s potential in terms of ongoing public education.<!-- page 334 -->
However, as Commissioners of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada, we are both confident and convinced that public dialogue is critical to the reconciliation process.<!-- page 334 --></p>
</section><section class="section3" id="the-arts-practising-resistance-healing-and-reconciliation"><h3><a class="toclink" href="#the-arts-practising-resistance-healing-and-reconciliation">The arts: Practising resistance, healing, and reconciliation<!-- page 335 --></a></h3>
<p>The reconciliation process is not easy.<!-- page 335 -->
It asks those who have been harmed to revisit painful memories and those who have harmed others—either directly or indirectly—to be accountable for past wrongs.<!-- page 335 -->
It asks us to mourn and commemorate the terrible loss of people, cultures, and languages, even as we celebrate their survival and revitalization.<!-- page 335 -->
It asks us to envision a more just and inclusive future, even as we struggle with the living legacies of injustice.<!-- page 335 -->
As the TRC has experienced in every region of the country, creative expression can play a vital role in this national reconciliation, providing alternative voices, vehicles, and venues for expressing historical truths and present hopes.<!-- page 335 -->
Creative expression supports everyday practices of resistance, healing, and commemoration at individual, community, regional, and national levels.<!-- page 335 --></p>
<p>Across the globe, the arts have provided a creative pathway to breaking silences, transforming conflicts, and mending the damaged relationships of violence, oppression, and exclusion.<!-- page 335 -->
From war-ravaged countries to local communities struggling with everyday violence, poverty, and racism, the arts are widely used by educators, practitioners, and community leaders to deal with trauma and difficult emotions, and communicate across cultural divides.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^206</a><!-- page 335 --></p>
<p>Art is active, and “participation in the arts is a guarantor of other human rights because the first thing that is taken away from vulnerable, unpopular or minority groups is the right to self-expression.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^207</a><!-- page 335 -->
The arts help to restore human dignity and identity in the face of injustice.<!-- page 335 -->
Properly structured, they can also invite people to explore their own world views, values, beliefs, and attitudes that may be barriers to healing, justice, and reconciliation.<!-- page 335 --></p>
<p>Even prior to the establishment of the TRC, a growing body of work, including Survivors’ memoirs and works of fiction by well-known Indigenous authors, as well as films and plays, have brought the residential school history and legacy to a wider Canadian public, enabling them to learn about the schools through the eyes of Survivors.<!-- page 335 -->
This body of work includes memoirs such as Isabelle Knockwood’s <em>Out of the Depths: The Experiences of Mi’kmaw Children at the Indian Residential School at Shubenacadie, Nova Scotia</em> (1992), to the more recent works of Agnes Grant’s <em>Finding My Talk: How Fourteen Native Women Reclaimed Their Lives after Residential School</em> (2004); Alice Blondin’s <em>My Heart Shook Like a Drum: What I Learned at the Indian Mission Schools, Northwest Territories</em> (2009); Theodore Fontaine’s <em>Broken Circle: The Dark Legacy of Indian Residential Schools: A Memoir</em> (2010); Bev Sellars’s <em>They Called Me Number One: Secrets and Survival at an Indian Residential School</em> (2013); and Edmund Metatawabin and Alexandra Shimo’s <em>Up Ghost River: A Chief’s Journey through the Turbulent Waters of Native History</em> (2014).<!-- page 335 --></p>
<p>Works of fiction (sometimes drawn from the author’s own life experiences), such as Tomson Highway’s <em>Kiss of the Fur Queen</em> (1998), Robert Alexie’s <em>Porcupines and China Dolls</em> (2009), or Richard Wagamese’s <em>Indian Horse</em> (2012), tell stories about abuse, neglect, and loss that are also stories of healing, redemption, and hope.<!-- page 335 -->
In 2012, the Aboriginal Healing Foundation published <em>Speaking My Truth: Reflections on Reconciliation and Residential Schools</em>, and invited book clubs across the country to read and discuss the book.<!-- page 335 --><!-- page 336 -->
Documentary films such as <em>Where the Spirit Lives</em> (1989), <em>Kuper Island: Return to the Healing Circle</em> (1997), and <em>Muffins for Granny</em> (2008), as well as docu-dramas such as <em>We Were Children</em> (2012), all serve to educate Canadians and the wider world about the residential school experience, using the power of sound and images.<!-- page 336 -->
Intergenerational Survivor Georgina Lightning was the first Indigenous woman in North America to direct a full-length feature film, <em>Older Than America</em> (2008).<!-- page 336 -->
Kevin Loring’s stage play, <em>Where the Blood Mixes</em>, won the Governor General’s award for literary drama in 2009.<!-- page 336 -->
It combines drama and humour to tell the stories of three Survivors living in the aftermath of their residential school experiences.<!-- page 336 --></p>
<p>Art can be powerful and provocative.<!-- page 336 -->
Through their work, Indigenous artists seek to resist and challenge the cultural understandings of settler-dominated versions of Canada’s past and its present reality.<!-- page 336 -->
Sharing intercultural dialogue about history, responsibility, and transformation through the arts is potentially healing and transformative for both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal peoples.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^208</a><!-- page 336 -->
Yet, art does not always cross this cultural divide, and neither does it have to in order to have a high impact.<!-- page 336 -->
Acts of resistance sometimes take place in “irreconcilable spaces” where artists choose to keep their residential school experiences private or share them only with other Aboriginal people.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^209</a><!-- page 336 -->
This is also essential to individual and collective reclaiming of identity, culture, and community memory.<!-- page 336 --></p>
<p>The Commission notes that the use of creative arts in community workshops promotes healing for Survivors, their families, and the whole community through the recovery of cultural traditions.<!-- page 336 -->
In conducting surveys of 103 community-based healing projects, the Aboriginal Healing Foundation (AHF) found that 80% of those projects included cultural activities and traditional healing interventions.<!-- page 336 -->
These included Elders’ teachings, storytelling and traditional knowledge, language programs, land-based activities, feasts and powwows; and learning traditional art forms, harvesting medicines, and drumming, singing, and dancing.<!-- page 336 -->
The AHF report observed,<!-- page 336 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A notable component of successful healing programs was their diversity— interventions were blended and combined to create holistic programs that met the physical, emotional, cultural, and spiritual needs of participants.<!-- page 336 -->
Not surprisingly, arts-based interventions were included in many cultural activities (drum making, beading, singing, and drumming) as well as in therapeutic healing (art therapy and psychodrama).<a href="footnote-placeholder">^210</a><!-- page 336 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Aboriginal Healing Foundation’s findings make clear that creative art practices are highly effective in reconnecting Survivors and their families to their cultures, languages, and communities.<!-- page 336 -->
In our view, this confirms yet again that funding for community-based healing projects is an urgent priority for Aboriginal communities.<!-- page 336 --></p>
<p>Art exhibits have played a particularly powerful role in the process of healing and reconciliation.<!-- page 336 -->
In 2009, nationally acclaimed Anishinaabe artist Robert Houle, who attended the Sandy Bay residential school in Manitoba, created a series of twenty-four paintings to be housed permanently in the University of Manitoba’s School of Art Gallery.<!-- page 336 --><!-- page 337 -->
In an interview with <em>CBC News</em> on September 24, 2013, he explained that “during the process memories came back that he had previously suppressed …<!-- page 337 -->
[but that] he found the whole experience cathartic.<!-- page 337 -->
At the end, he felt a sigh of relief, a sigh of liberation.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^211</a><!-- page 337 --></p>
<p>Over the course of the Commission’s mandate, several major art exhibits ran concurrently with its National Events.<!-- page 337 -->
During the British Columbia National Event in Vancouver, for example, three major exhibits opened, featuring well-known Aboriginal artists, some of whom were also Survivors or intergenerational Survivors.<!-- page 337 -->
A number of non-Aboriginal artists were also featured.<!-- page 337 -->
Their work explored themes of denial, complicity, apology, and government policy.<!-- page 337 -->
Two of these exhibits were at the University of British Columbia: Witnesses: <em>Art and Canada’s Indian Residential Schools</em> at the Morris and Helen Belkin Art Gallery, and the Museum of Anthropology’s <em>Speaking to Memory: Images and Voices from the St. Michael’s Residential School</em>.<!-- page 337 -->
Both exhibits were collaborative efforts that also engaged Survivors, artists, and curatorial staff in related public education initiatives, including workshops, symposia, and public dialogues based on the exhibits.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^212</a><!-- page 337 --></p>
<p>A significant number of the statements gathered by the Commission also came to us in artistic formats.<!-- page 337 -->
Some Survivors said that although it hurt too much to tell their story in the usual way, they had been able to find their voice instead by writing a poem, a song, or a book.<!-- page 337 -->
Some made a video or audio recording, offered photographs, or produced a theatre performance piece or a film.<!-- page 337 -->
Others created traditional blankets, quilts, carvings, or paintings to depict residential school experiences, to celebrate those who survived them, or to commemorate those who did not.<!-- page 337 -->
Lasting public memory of the schools has therefore been produced not only through oral testimonies, but also through this wide range of artistic expressions.<!-- page 337 -->
The arts have opened up new and critical space for Survivors, artists, curators, and public audiences to explore the complexities of “truth,” “healing,” and “reconciliation.”<!-- page 337 --></p>
<p>The Commission funded or supported several arts-related projects.<!-- page 337 -->
Early in its mandate, the TRC sponsored the “Living Healing Quilt Project,” which was organized by Anishinaabe quilter Alice Williams from Curve Lake First Nation in Ontario.<!-- page 337 -->
Women Survivors and intergenerational Survivors from across the country created individual quilt blocks depicting their memories of residential schools.<!-- page 337 -->
These were then stitched together into three quilts, <em>Schools of Shame</em>, <em>Child Prisoners</em>, and <em>Crimes Against Humanity</em>.<!-- page 337 --></p>
<p>The quilts tell a complex story of trauma, loss, isolation, recovery, healing, and hope through women’s eyes.<!-- page 337 -->
The sewing skills taught to young Aboriginal girls in the residential schools and passed along to their daughters and granddaughters are now used to stitch together a counter-narrative.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^213</a><!-- page 337 -->
This project also inspired the “Healing Quilt Project,” which linked education and art.<!-- page 337 -->
At the Manitoba National Event, as an expression of reconciliation, the Women’s and Gender Studies and Aboriginal Governance departments at the University of Winnipeg gave the TRC a quilt created by students and professors as part of their coursework.<!-- page 337 --><!-- page 338 -->
Through classroom readings, dialogue, and art, they created a space for learning about, and reflecting on, the residential school history and legacy in the context of reconciliation.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^214</a><!-- page 338 --></p>
<p>A report commissioned by the TRC, “Practicing Reconciliation: A Collaborative Study of Aboriginal Art, Resistance and Cultural Politics,” was based on the findings of a one-year research project.<!-- page 338 -->
Working with Survivors, artists, and curators, a multidisciplinary team of researchers examined the general question of how artistic practice contributes to the reconciliation process.<!-- page 338 -->
The research was done through a series of interviews, workshops, artist residencies, planning sessions, symposia, artistic incubations, publications, and online learning platforms.<!-- page 338 -->
The report reveals the depth and potential of arts-based approaches to reconciliation.<!-- page 338 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>We should begin by echoing what many of our interview and artist subjects have repeatedly said: that the act of reconciliation is itself deeply complicated, and that success should not be measured by achieving a putative [commonly accepted or supposed] reconciliation, but by movement towards these lofty goals.<!-- page 338 -->
Indeed, it could be proposed that full reconciliation is both mercurial and impossible, and that the efforts of theorists, artists, survivors, and the various publics engaged in this difficult process are best focused on working collaboratively for better understanding our histories, our traumas, and ourselves.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^215</a><!-- page 338 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>These various projects indicate that the arts and artistic practices may serve to shape public memory in ways that are potentially transformative for individuals, communities, and national history.<!-- page 338 --></p>
</section><section class="section3" id="residential-school-commemoration-projects"><h3><a class="toclink" href="#residential-school-commemoration-projects">Residential school commemoration projects<!-- page 338 --></a></h3>
<p>Commemoration should not put closure to the history and legacy of the residential schools.<!-- page 338 -->
Rather, it must invite citizens into a dialogue about a contentious past and why this history still matters today.<!-- page 338 -->
Commemorations and memorials at former school sites and cemeteries are visible reminders of Canada’s shame and church complicity.<!-- page 338 -->
They bear witness to the suffering and loss that generations of Aboriginal peoples have endured and overcome.<!-- page 338 -->
The process of remembering the past together is an emotional journey of contradictory feelings: loss and resilience, anger and acceptance, denial and remorse, shame and pride, despair and hope.<!-- page 338 -->
The Settlement Agreement identified the historic importance and reconciliation potential of such remembering by establishing a special fund for projects that would commemorate the residential school experience, and by assigning a role in the approval of these projects to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada.<!-- page 338 --></p>
<p>As previously noted in this report’s section about the Commission’s activities, commemoration projects across the country were funded under the terms of the Settlement Agreement.<!-- page 338 -->
Twenty million dollars were set aside for Aboriginal communities and various partners and organizations to undertake community-based, regional or national projects.<!-- page 338 --><!-- page 339 -->
The Commission evaluated and made recommendations to the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada, which was responsible for administering the funding for the commemoration projects.<!-- page 339 --></p>
<p>Unlike more conventional state commemorations, which have tended to reinforce Canada’s story as told through colonial eyes, residential school commemorative projects challenged and recast public memory and national history.<!-- page 339 -->
Many First Nations, Inuit, and Métis communities partnered with regional or national Aboriginal organizations, and involved local churches, governments, and their non-Aboriginal neighbours.<!-- page 339 -->
The scope, breadth, and creativity of the projects were truly impressive.<!-- page 339 -->
Projects ranged from traditional and virtual quilts, monuments and memorials, traditional medicine gardens, totem pole and canoe carving, oral history, community ceremonies and feasts, land-based culture and language camps, cemetery restoration, film and digital storytelling, commemorative walking trails, and theatre or dance productions.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^216</a><!-- page 339 --></p>
<p>The Commission, advised by the TRC Survivor Committee, identified three elements of the commemoration process that were seen as being essential to supporting long-term reconciliation.<!-- page 339 -->
First, the projects were to be Survivor-driven; that is, their success was contingent upon the advice, recommendations, and active participation of Survivors.<!-- page 339 -->
Second, commemoration projects would forge new connections that linked Aboriginal family and community memory to Canada’s public memory and national history.<!-- page 339 -->
Third, incorporating Indigenous oral history and memory practices into commemoration projects would ensure that the processes of remembering places, reclaiming identity, and revitalizing cultures were consistent with the principle of self-determination.<!-- page 339 --></p>
<p>Commemorating the life stories of Survivors strengthens the bonds of family and community memory that have been disrupted but not destroyed.<!-- page 339 -->
Families grieve for all that was lost and can never be recovered.<!-- page 339 -->
The act of commemoration remembers and honours those who are no longer living and comforts those for whom a history of injustice and oppression is still very much alive.<!-- page 339 -->
Commemorations can also symbolize hope, signifying cultural revitalization and the reclaiming of history and identity.<!-- page 339 -->
Even as they grieve, families envision a better future for children and youth and for generations yet unborn.<!-- page 339 --></p>
<p>The collective memory of Aboriginal peoples lives in places: in their traditional homelands and in the actual physical locations where residential schools once stood.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^217</a><!-- page 339 -->
On March 24, 2014, the Grand Council of Treaty 3 brought together Survivors, Elders, and others in Kenora, Ontario, for a final ceremony to mark commemorations that were held earlier at each site of the five residential schools that were located in the territory.<!-- page 339 -->
Monuments had been placed at each of the sites.<!-- page 339 -->
Richard Green, who coordinated the two-year memorial project, said, “This is a commemoration for all the sites together.<!-- page 339 -->
This meeting is about honouring all the children and is part of remembering the legacy.<!-- page 339 -->
Lest we forget, as they say.<!-- page 339 -->
We can probably forgive, but we can never forget our history.”<!-- page 339 -->

<p>The story of a small collection of children’s art created at the Alberni residential school in the 1950s and 1960s demonstrates how recognizing and respecting Indigenous protocols and practices of ceremony, testimony, and witnessing can breathe life, healing, and transformation into public memory making through dialogue, the arts, and commemoration.<!-- page 340 -->
The story has deep roots within the family histories of the Survivors and in the oral history and community memory of the Nuu-chah-nulth peoples.<!-- page 340 --></p>
<p>The paintings from the Alberni residential school are part of a larger collection of Indigenous children’s art donated to the University of Victoria in 2009 by the late artist Robert Aller.<!-- page 340 -->
As a resident of Port Alberni, British Columbia, Aller initially volunteered his time to teach art classes to selected students outside of the regular curriculum at the residential school.<!-- page 340 -->
He was hired by Indian Affairs to teach art between 1956 and 1987 at the Alberni school, and also at the McKay residential school in Dauphin, Manitoba, as well as in Aboriginal communities in several other provinces.<!-- page 340 --></p>
<p>There are over 750 paintings in the collection, including 36 paintings from the Alberni residential school.<!-- page 340 -->
Aller also donated to the university his private papers, and hundreds of photographs, slides, and archival documents that detail his teaching philosophy and approach to art.<!-- page 340 -->
Aller did not agree with the philosophy behind the residential schools.<!-- page 340 -->
He saw art as a way to free students from their everyday environment and as a way for them to express their creativity, through either traditionally inspired works, or paintings that used the theories and ideas of the contemporary art world.<!-- page 340 -->
The paintings from the Alberni residential school portray images of landscapes, people, animals, masks, and traditional stories, as well as some images of the school itself.<!-- page 340 -->
Most of the artists signed their paintings, putting their age next to their name.<!-- page 340 -->
In this sense, the children stand out; the anonymity that depersonalizes so much of the residential school history is removed.<!-- page 340 --></p>
<p>In 2010, University of Victoria’s Dr.<!-- page 340 -->
Andrea Walsh, who was in the early stages of a research project on the art collection, met with the Commissioners and we urged her to begin her research with ceremony.<!-- page 340 -->
She turned to two Elders from the First Peoples House at the university to guide her in this process: Tousilum (Ron George), who is a residential school Survivor; and Sulsa’meeth (Deb George), his wife.<!-- page 340 -->
They helped her to reach out to Survivors, Elders, and chiefs in Port Alberni in Nuu-chah-nulth territory when the group travelled there with the paintings.<!-- page 340 -->
As community members leafed through the paintings drawn by children’s hands so many years ago, memories were shared about the artists, the school, and the parents and communities they had left behind.<!-- page 340 --></p>
<p>Working under the direction of these community members, and in collaboration with her colleague, Qwul’sih’yah’maht (Dr.<!-- page 341 -->
Robina Thomas), and TRC staff, Walsh began preparations to bring the artwork to the Learning Place at the TRC’s Victoria Regional Event in April 2012.<!-- page 341 -->
In a powerfully moving ceremony, Nuu-chah-nulth Elders, Survivors, and Hereditary Chiefs drummed, sang, and danced the art into the Learning Place.<!-- page 341 -->
In this way, each painting, carried with respect and love by a Nuu-chah-nulth woman dressed in button blanket regalia, was brought out to be shared with others.<!-- page 341 --></p>
<p>The community later received commemoration project funding to hold a traditional feast on March 30, 2013, in Port Alberni to reunite artists and their families with the paintings.<!-- page 341 -->
Robert Aller’s family members were also invited to attend.<!-- page 341 -->
They were visibly moved when they heard the stories of the paintings, and said that Aller would have been happy that the paintings were being returned.<!-- page 341 -->
Paintings were returned to those who wished to have them; the remaining art was loaned to the University of Victoria, where it will be housed, cared for, and exhibited, based on agreed-upon protocols with Survivors and their families.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^219</a><!-- page 341 --></p>
<p>In a media interview, Survivor and Hereditary Chief Lewis George said that the art classes probably saved him from being sexually abused by convicted pedophile Arthur Plint, who had taught at the Alberni residential school.<!-- page 341 -->
He remembered the kindness shown to him by Aller as being in stark contrast to the harsh realities of life at the school, and he said, “I want my story kept alive.”<!-- page 341 -->
Wally Samuel, another Survivor of the Alberni school who helped co-ordinate the project, said everyone reacted differently when told about the paintings.<!-- page 341 -->
“Some got really quiet and others looked forward to seeing them …<!-- page 341 -->
but they all remembered being in art class.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^220</a><!-- page 341 --></p>
<p>In May of 2013, the Alberni residential school paintings were displayed in a special exhibit, To Reunite, To Honour, To Witness, at the Legacy Art Gallery at the University of Victoria.<!-- page 341 -->
Survivors, Elders, and community members continue to work with Walsh and Qwul’sih’yah’maht to document the story of the creation and return of the children’s paintings as part of reconnecting individual, family, and community memory, and educating the public about a previously unknown part of the history and legacy of the residential schools.<!-- page 341 --></p>
<p>In September 2013, the paintings returned once again to the Learning Place at the TRC’s British Columbia National Event in Vancouver, and the group made an expression of reconciliation by providing copies of the artwork to the Commission’s Bentwood Box, to become part of the permanent record of the Commission’s work.<!-- page 341 --></p>

<p>The Commission takes note of the federal government’s own national commemoration initiative, which was described as an “expression of reconciliation” when it was publicly announced at the Atlantic National Event in 2011.<!-- page 341 --><!-- page 342 -->
It is a specially commissioned stainedglass window entitled <em>Giniigaaniimenaaning</em> or <em>Looking Ahead</em>, designed by Métis artist Christi Belcourt.<!-- page 342 -->
Its two-sided imagery depicts the history of the residential schools, the cultural resilience of Aboriginal peoples, and hope for the future.<!-- page 342 -->
The window was permanently installed in the Centre Block of the federal parliament buildings, and unveiled in a dedication ceremony on November 26, 2012.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^221</a><!-- page 342 -->
Putting this window in such a prominent public place helps to make the history and legacy of residential schools more visible to the Canadian public and the world at large, while also acknowledging the federal government’s responsibility in establishing the residential school system.<!-- page 342 --></p>
<p>At the dedication ceremony, artist Christi Belcourt said that her inspiration for the window’s design came from Survivors themselves.<!-- page 342 -->
She said,<!-- page 342 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The stories of residential school students were never told in this building, so I’m going to tell you one now…<!-- page 342 -->
I asked Lucille [Kelly-Davis] who is a residential school survivor what she wanted to see on the window.<!-- page 342 -->
I had assisted her through the residential school settlement process, and like so many survivors, her story is horrific…<!-- page 342 -->
Despite her childhood, she married, had four children, and now has many grandchildren.<!-- page 342 -->
She is a pipe carrier, attends traditional ceremonies, and helps younger people learn the traditions.<!-- page 342 -->
She’s a powerful Anishnabeg grandmother who is generous, loving and caring, and gives all she can to her community and her family.<!-- page 342 -->
She is not a victim, but a survivor.<!-- page 342 -->
When I asked her what to put on the window, she said, “Tell our side of the story.”…<!-- page 342 -->
She said, “Make it about hope.”…<!-- page 342 -->
It’s about looking ahead, as the name of the window says, “giniigaaniimenaaning” looking to the future for those yet unborn…<!-- page 342 --></p>
<p>Because she told me to make it about hope, what I’ve tried to show in the design is all the positive things I’ve seen in my life.<!-- page 342 -->
Despite residential schools, children, adults, and Elders dance in full regalia in celebration of who they are as Indigenous people.<!-- page 342 -->
We see Métis youth learning fiddling and jigging with pride across the country.<!-- page 342 -->
We see arenas full of Inuk Elders drum dancing, with little kids running around, speaking Inuktitut.<!-- page 342 -->
We see whole communities come together in times of joy and in times of great grief.<!-- page 342 -->
The lodges are growing, the traditional songs are being sung, the ceremonies are being taught, and the ceremonies are still practiced.<!-- page 342 --></p>
<p>I wish I could show the government that reconciliation has the potential to be so much more.<!-- page 342 -->
I wish I could convince them that reconciliation is not an unattainable goal, if there’s the will and the courage to discard old paternalistic ways of thinking and of behaviour.<!-- page 342 -->
We need action, and where we need action, don’t meet us with silence.<!-- page 342 -->
Where we need support, don’t accuse us of being a burden…<!-- page 342 -->
I wish I could speak to the hearts of mps, whether Conservative, or ndp, or Liberal, and let them know that renewal and reconciliation can be found between Aboriginal peoples and the rest of Canada through the sustained wellness of generations of Aboriginal people to come.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^222</a><!-- page 342 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>At Commission hearings, we heard from many Survivors about windows.<!-- page 343 -->
We heard from those who looked out from the school windows, waiting and hoping to see their parents come for them; those who cried when no one came for them, especially when it was Christmas or another holiday.<!-- page 343 -->
We heard from those who were told, sometimes being pulled away from the window by the hair, to “get away from that window,” or “your parents are not coming for you anyway.”<!-- page 343 -->
We heard from those who simply looked out into the dark or into the distance, crying because they were so lonesome and homesick.<!-- page 343 -->
Windows were also a beacon of hope.<!-- page 343 -->
Survivors also told us how they smiled and laughed and couldn’t contain their tears of joy when they looked out the window and saw their parents or grandparents coming to visit them or take them away from the school.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^223</a><!-- page 343 -->
The windows of the residential schools evoked both good and bad memories for Survivors.<!-- page 343 -->
Thus, a commemorative window seems a fitting monument to remember and honour the children who went to residential schools.<!-- page 343 --></p>
<p>Commemorations in highly visible public spaces such as the parliament buildings create openings for dialogue about what happened, why, and what can be learned from this history.<!-- page 343 -->
Through dialogue, citizens can strengthen their ability to “accommodate difference, acknowledge injustice, and demonstrate a willingness to share authority over the past.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^224</a><!-- page 343 -->
In the context of national reconciliation, ongoing public commemoration has the potential to contribute to human rights education in the broadest sense.<!-- page 343 --></p>
<p>Although Canada’s commemorative window was a significant gesture of reconciliation, the Commission believes that the federal government must do more to ensure that national commemoration of the history and legacy of residential schools becomes an integral part of Canadian heritage and national history.<!-- page 343 -->
Under the <em>Historic Sites and Monuments Act</em> (1985), the minister responsible for Parks Canada has the authority to designate historic sites of national significance and approve commemorative monuments or plaques.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^225</a><!-- page 343 -->
The minister is advised by the Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada “on the commemoration of nationally significant aspects of Canada’s past, including the designation of national historic sites, persons and events.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^226</a><!-- page 343 -->
The board reviews and makes recommendations on submissions received from Canadian citizens who make nominations through the National Program of Historical Commemoration.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^227</a><!-- page 343 -->
Heritage sites, monuments, and plaques that celebrate Canada’s past are common, but commemorating those aspects of our national history that reveal cultural genocide, human rights violations, racism, and injustice are more problematic.<!-- page 343 --></p>
<p>As we noted earlier, at the international level, the <em>Joinet-Orentlicher Principles</em> adopted by the United Nations have established that states have a responsibility to take measures to ensure that collective violence against a targeted group of people does not reoccur.<!-- page 343 -->
In addition to providing compensation, making apologies, and undertaking educational reform, states also have a duty “to remember.”<!-- page 343 -->
Under Principle 2,<!-- page 343 --></p>
<p>A people’s knowledge of the history of its oppression is part of its heritage and, as such, must be preserved by appropriate measures in fulfillment of the State’s duty to remember…<!-- page 343 --><!-- page 344 -->
On a collective basis, symbolic measures intended to provide moral reparation, such as formal public recognition by the State of its responsibility, or official declarations aimed at restoring victims’ dignity, commemorative ceremonies, naming of public thoroughfares or the erection of monuments, help to discharge the duty of remembrance.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^228</a><!-- page 344 --></p>
<p>In 2014, the UN Special Rapporteur in the field of Cultural Rights, Farida Shaheed, issued a report on memorialization processes in countries where victims and their families, working collaboratively with artists and various civic society groups, have commemorated their experiences in unofficial ways that may run counter to state-sanctioned versions of national history.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^229</a><!-- page 344 -->
Shaheed observed that the commemorations of Indigenous peoples’ experience—both their oppression and their positive contributions to society—that have occurred in many countries, including Canada, have not been state-driven initiatives.<!-- page 344 -->
Rather, they have been initiated by Indigenous peoples themselves.<!-- page 344 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In Canada, a memorial to indigenous veterans from the First World War was built at the request of indigenous peoples, integrating many elements of indigenous cultures.<!-- page 344 -->
This recognition took place at a later stage in history, however, and in a different venue to the main memorial established for other Canadian soldiers.<!-- page 344 -->
Commemoration projects are also taking place …<!-- page 344 -->
regarding the history of Indian residential schools.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^230</a><!-- page 344 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The report concluded that state authorities have a key role to play in the commemoration process.<!-- page 344 -->
The state is responsible for managing public space and has the capacity to maintain monuments and develop long-term national commemoration policies and strategies.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^231</a><!-- page 344 --></p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur further concluded that states should ensure that<!-- page 344 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>memorial policies contribute to, in particular …<!-- page 344 -->
providing symbolic reparation and public recognition to the victims in ways that respond to the needs of all victims oppressed in a recent or distant past and contribute to their healing …<!-- page 344 -->
the development of reconciliation policies between groups …<!-- page 344 -->
[and] promoting civic engagement, critical thinking and stimulating discussions on the representation of the past, as well as contemporary challenges of exclusion and violence.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^232</a><!-- page 344 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The report recommended that states and relevant stakeholders<!-- page 344 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>promote critical thinking on past events by ensuring that memorialisation processes are complemented by measures fostering historical awareness and support the implementation and outreach of high-quality research projects, cultural interventions that encourage people’s direct engagement and educational activities…<!-- page 344 -->
States should ensure the availability of public spaces for a diversity of narratives conveyed in artistic expressions and multiply opportunities for such narratives to engage with each other…<!-- page 344 -->
[States must also] take into consideration the cultural dimension of memorial processes, including where repression has targeted indigenous peoples.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^233</a><!-- page 344 --><!-- page 345 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Commission concurs with these conclusions and recommendations.<!-- page 345 -->
They are consistent with our own findings on the residential schools commemoration projects.<!-- page 345 -->
These Survivor-driven, community-based initiatives revealed the importance of integrating Indigenous knowledge and revitalizing Indigenous memory practices in commemorating the history and legacy of residential schools.<!-- page 345 -->
They demonstrated the critical role that artists play in healing and commemoration.<!-- page 345 --></p>
<p>The Commission believes that Canada’s national heritage network also has a vital role to play in reconciliation.<!-- page 345 -->
Our views were further confirmed in a study of residential school commemorations in the context of Canada’s national heritage and commemoration policy.<!-- page 345 -->
The research documented the Assembly of First Nations’ and the Aboriginal Healing Foundation’s national commemoration project to create a heritage plaque program to place commemorative markers at all residential school sites across the country.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^234</a><!-- page 345 -->
Faced with logistical challenges and based on input from Survivors and communities, “the project transformed from what ostensibly had been an IRS [Indian Residential School] site heritage plaque program to a community-oriented public monumental art project.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^235</a><!-- page 345 -->
The commemorative markers were not placed at residential school sites, many of which are in remote locations or otherwise inaccessible.<!-- page 345 -->
Instead, they were placed in Aboriginal communities where Survivors and their families could access them more easily, where ceremonies and community events could be held, and where there were opportunities for ongoing healing, commemoration, and education.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^236</a><!-- page 345 --></p>
<p>The study revealed the fundamental tensions that exist between the goals of Aboriginal peoples and Canada with regard to the commemoration of residential schools.<!-- page 345 -->
Under the existing policies of Parks Canada’s Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada National Program of Historical Commemoration, residential school sites do not meet the program criteria for heritage designation, which is based on Western heritage values of conservation and preservation.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^237</a><!-- page 345 -->
For Survivors, their families, and communities, commemorating their residential school experiences does not necessarily involve preserving the school buildings, but is intended instead to contribute to individual and collective healing.<!-- page 345 -->
For example, a residential school located in Port Alberni, British Columbia, was demolished by Survivors and their families, who burned sage and cedar in ceremonies in order to “cleanse and allow the trapped spirits to finally be freed.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^238</a><!-- page 345 -->
Where commemoration activities have involved the destruction of a residential school structure, such actions are in direct conflict with Canadian heritage goals.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^239</a><!-- page 345 --></p>
<p>Ultimately, reconciliation requires a paradigm shift in Canada’s national heritage values, policies, and practices that focus on conservation and continue to exclude Indigenous history, heritage values, and memory practices, which prioritize healing and the reclaiming of culture in public commemoration.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^240</a><!-- page 345 -->
For this to happen, Parks Canada’s heritage and commemoration policies and programs must change.<!-- page 345 --></p>
<p>By shaping commemoration projects to meet their own needs, Survivors, their families, and communities have provided a wealth of information and best practices for commemorating the history and legacy of the residential school system.<!-- page 346 -->
These can inform and enrich the National Program of Historical Commemoration and the work of the Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada to ensure that Canada’s heritage and commemoration legislation, programs, policies, and practices contribute constructively to the reconciliation process in the years ahead.<!-- page 346 --></p>

<p>The media has a role to play in ensuring that public information both for and about Aboriginal peoples reflects their cultural diversity and provides fair and non-discriminatory reporting on Aboriginal issues.<!-- page 347 -->
This is consistent with Article 16:2 of the <em>United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples</em>, which says, “States shall take effective measures to ensure that State-owned media duly reflect indigenous cultural diversity.”<!-- page 347 -->
Canada’s <em>Broadcasting Act</em> (1991) sets out national broadcasting policy for all Canadian broadcasters with regard to Aboriginal peoples.<!-- page 347 -->
The policy states the need to,<!-- page 347 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>through its programming and employment opportunities arising out of its operations, serve the needs and interests, and reflect the circumstances and aspirations of Canadian men, women, and children, including equal rights, the linguistic duality and multicultural and multiracial nature of Canadian society, and the special place of aboriginal peoples within that society.[S. 3.1.d.iii]<!-- page 347 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Act then states a more controversial obligation, that “programming that reflects the aboriginal cultures of Canada should be provided within the Canadian broadcasting system as resources become available for the purpose” (S.3.1.o).<a href="footnote-placeholder">^241</a><!-- page 347 --></p>
<p>A submission to the federal Task Force on Aboriginal Languages and Cultures in 2004 pointed out deficiencies in the <em>Broadcasting Act</em> related to these service provisions for Aboriginal peoples.<!-- page 347 -->
It stated:<!-- page 347 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Act did not enshrine Aboriginal language broadcasting as a priority: instead it noted that … [S. S. 3.1.d.iii] means that Aboriginal language programming is not recognized nor protected to the same extent as English and French programming …<!-- page 347 -->
[and that] the phrase “as resources become available for the purpose” [S.3.1.o] has become a stumbling block for many producers and programmers, linking the availability of Aboriginal language broadcasting to the political process.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^242</a><!-- page 347 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The report recommended that the <em>Broadcasting Act</em> be revised to address these gaps.<!-- page 347 -->
As of 2014, these provisions of the Act remain unchanged.<!-- page 347 --></p>
<p>As Canada’s national public broadcaster, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC/ Radio-Canada) is responsible for fulfilling national broadcasting policy.<!-- page 347 -->
For many years, it has been providing a minimum level of Aboriginal radio and television programming and news, in a few specific regions, including some Aboriginal-language programming, especially in northern Canada.<!-- page 347 -->
In the Commission’s view, the budget cuts to the CBC over the past decade have significantly reduced and further limited its capacity to provide Aboriginal programming and dedicated news coverage on Aboriginal issues, and to increase the number of Aboriginal people in staff and leadership positions.<!-- page 347 --><!-- page 348 -->
As of March 31, 2014, Aboriginal people made up 1.6% of the CBC workforce, well below the demographic makeup of Aboriginal people, who represent 4.3% of the total Canadian population.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^243</a><!-- page 348 --></p>
<p>The Aboriginal Peoples Television Network (APTN), an independent, non-profit broadcaster, has taken a leadership role since the 1990s, in part to make up for the programming and scheduling limitations of CBC/Radio-Canada, to provide nationwide programming and news that reflects Aboriginal peoples’ perspectives, concerns, and experiences.<!-- page 348 -->
The APTN has provided an outlet for Aboriginal journalists, producers, directors, writers, artists, and musicians, and attracts a wide Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Canadian and international audience.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^244</a><!-- page 348 -->
As of 2014, over 75% of APTN employees were Aboriginal, and 28% of its programming was broadcast in various Aboriginal languages.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^245</a><!-- page 348 -->
In the Commission’s view, the APTN is well positioned to provide media leadership to support the reconciliation process.<!-- page 348 --></p>
<p>National public and private broadcasters must provide comprehensive and timely information and services to Aboriginal peoples and the Canadian public.<!-- page 348 --></p>

<p>In a submission to the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples (RCAP) in 1993, the Canadian Association of Journalists noted, “The country’s large newspapers, tv and radio news shows often contain misinformation, sweeping generalizations, and galling stereotypes about Natives and Native affairs…<!-- page 349 -->
The result is that most Canadians have little real knowledge of the country’s Native peoples, or the issues that affect them.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^246</a><!-- page 349 -->
In 1996, the RCAP report had noted,<!-- page 349 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Public opinion polls in the past few years have consistently shown broad sympathy for Aboriginal issues and concerns, but that support is not very deep.<!-- page 349 -->
More recent events have brought a hardening of attitudes towards Aboriginal issues in many parts of the country…<!-- page 349 -->
This growing hostility can be traced in large part to recent negative publicity over land claims, Aboriginal hunting and fishing rights, and issues of taxation.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^247</a><!-- page 349 --></p>

<p>More recent studies indicate that this historical pattern persists.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^248</a><!-- page 349 -->

<p>“as coverage related to the protests and talks between Aboriginal people and government became more frequent, the proportion of stories with a negative tone correspondingly increased.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^250</a><!-- page 349 --></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Media coverage of residential schools was low.<!-- page 349 -->
From June 1, 2011, to May 31, 2012, media coverage of Aboriginal issues in Ontario accounted for only 0.23% of all news stories, and, of these, only 3.0% focused on residential schools.<!-- page 349 -->
From June 1, 2012, to May 31, 2013, news stories on Aboriginal issues amounted to 0.46% of all news stories, and, of these, 3.0% focused on deaths in residential schools.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^251</a><!-- page 349 --></p>
<p>The report included expert opinions on its findings, including those of CBC journalist Duncan McCue, who observed that editorial opinions “are often rooted in century-old stereotypes rather than reality.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^252</a><!-- page 349 -->
He pointed out:<!-- page 349 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, protests often meet the test of whether a story is ‘newsworthy,’ because they’re unusual, dramatic, or involve conflict.<!-- page 349 -->
Yes, Aboriginal activists, who understand the media’s hunger for drama, also play a role by tailoring protests in ways that guarantee prominent headlines and lead stories.<!-- page 349 -->
But, does today’s front-page news of some traffic disruption in the name of Aboriginal land rights actually have its roots in a much older narrative—of violent and “uncivilized” Indians who represent a threat to ‘progress’ in Canada?<!-- page 349 --><!-- page 350 -->
Are attitudes of distrust and fear underlying our decisions to dispatch a crew to the latest Aboriginal blockade?<!-- page 350 -->
Is there no iconic photo of reconciliation, because no one from the newsrooms believes harmony between Aboriginal peoples and settlers is ‘newsworthy’?<a href="footnote-placeholder">^253</a><!-- page 350 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Historian J. R. Miller has observed that when conflicts between Aboriginal peoples and the state have occurred in places like Oka or Ipperwash Park, for example, “politicians, journalists and ordinary citizens understood neither how nor why the crisis of the moment had arisen, much less how its deep historical roots made it resistant to solutions…<!-- page 350 -->
[This] does not bode well for effective public debate or sensible policy-making.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^254</a><!-- page 350 --></p>
<p>In the Commission’s view, the media’s role and responsibility in the reconciliation process require journalists to be well informed about the history of Aboriginal peoples and the issues that affect their lives.<!-- page 350 -->
As we have seen, this is not necessarily the case.<!-- page 350 -->
Studies of media coverage of conflicts involving Aboriginal peoples have borne this out.<!-- page 350 -->
In the conflict between some of the descendants of members of the Stony Point Reserve and their supporters and the Ontario Provincial Police in Ipperwash Provincial Park in 1995, which resulted in the death of Dudley George, journalism professor John Miller concluded,<!-- page 350 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Much of the opinion—and there was a lot of it—was based not on the facts of the Ipperwash occupation, but on crude generalizations about First Nations people that fit many of the racist stereotypes that …<!-- page 350 -->
have [been] identified…<!-- page 350 -->
Accurate, comprehensive coverage can promote understanding and resolution, just as inaccurate, incomplete and myopic coverage can exacerbate stereotypes and prolong confrontations…<!-- page 350 -->
Reporters are professionally trained to engage in a discipline of verification, a process that is often mistakenly referred to as “objectivity.”<!-- page 350 -->
But …<!-- page 350 -->
research shows that news is not selected randomly or objectively.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^255</a><!-- page 350 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Miller identified nine principles of journalism that journalists themselves have identified as essential to their work.<!-- page 350 -->
Of those, he said,<!-- page 350 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Journalism’s first obligation is to the truth…<!-- page 350 -->
Journalism does not pursue truth in an absolute or philosophical sense, but it can—and must—pursue it in a practical sense…<!-- page 350 -->
Even in a world of expanding voices, accuracy is the foundation upon which everything else is built—context, interpretation, comment, criticism, analysis and debate.<!-- page 350 -->
The truth, over time, emerges from this forum…<!-- page 350 --></p>
<p>Its practitioners must be allowed to exercise their personal conscience.<!-- page 350 -->
Every journalist must have a personal sense of ethics and responsibility—a moral compass.<!-- page 350 -->
Each of us must be willing, if fairness and accuracy require, to voice differences with our colleagues…<!-- page 350 -->
This stimulates the intellectual diversity necessary to understand and accurately cover an increasingly diverse society.<!-- page 350 -->
It is this diversity of minds and voices, not just numbers, that matters.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^256</a><!-- page 350 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>With respect to the history and legacy of residential schools, all the major radio and television networks and newspapers covered the events and activities of the Commission.<!-- page 350 --></p>
<p>The TRC provided regular information briefings to the media who attended the National Events.<!-- page 351 -->
We discussed earlier how students must not only learn the truth about what happened in residential schools, but also understand the ethical dimensions of this history.<!-- page 351 -->
So too must journalists.<!-- page 351 -->
Many of the reporters who covered the National Events were themselves deeply affected by what they heard from Survivors and their families.<!-- page 351 -->
Some required the assistance of health-support workers.<!-- page 351 -->
Some told us in off-the-record conversations that their perspectives and understanding of the impacts of residential schools, and the need for healing and reconciliation, had changed, based on their observations and experiences at the National Events.<!-- page 351 --></p>

<p>The Commission heard from Survivors that the opportunity to play sports at residential school made their lives more bearable and gave them a sense of identity, accomplishment, and pride.<!-- page 351 -->
At the Alberta National Event, Survivor Theodore (Ted) Fontaine placed a bundle of mementoes into the Bentwood Box as expressions of reconciliation.<!-- page 351 -->
It included a pair of baseball pants that he had worn at residential school.<!-- page 351 -->
He said,<!-- page 351 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>These woollen baseball pants carry a story of their own …<!-- page 351 -->
these are the baseball pants that I wore in 1957–58, as a fifteen-year-old incarcerated boy at the Fort Alexander residential school…<!-- page 351 -->
Little did I know that my mom would treasure and keep them as a memento of her youngest boy.<!-- page 351 -->
When I leave this land, they won’t have anywhere else to go, so I hope the Bentwood Box keeps them well…<!-- page 351 --></p>
<p>When we were little boys at Fort Alexander residential school, our only chance to play hockey literally did save our lives.<!-- page 351 -->
A lot of people here will attest to that.<!-- page 351 -->
As a young man, playing hockey saved me…<!-- page 351 -->
And later, playing with the Sagkeeng Old-Timers saved me again…<!-- page 351 -->
I came back twenty years later, fifteen years later and started playing with an old-timers hockey team in Fort Alexander…<!-- page 351 -->
In 1983, we ended up winning the first World Cup by an Indigenous team, in Munich, Germany…<!-- page 351 -->
So I’m including in this bundle, a story of the old-timers, a battalion of Anishinaabe hockey players who saved themselves and their friends by winning, not only winning in Munich, Germany, but in three or four other hockey tournaments in Europe…<!-- page 351 --></p>
<p>People ask me, “Why don’t you just enjoy life now instead of working so hard on reconciliation and talking about residential schools?<!-- page 352 -->
What do you expect to achieve?”<!-- page 352 -->
The answer is “freedom.”<!-- page 352 -->
I am free.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^257</a><!-- page 352 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Later that same day, journalist Laura Robinson’s expression of reconciliation was a copy of the documentary <em>FrontRunners</em>, which she produced for APTN, about some residential school athletes who had made history.<!-- page 352 -->
She said,<!-- page 352 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 1967, ten teenage First Nations boys, all good students and great runners, ran with the 1967 Pan Am Games torch, from St.<!-- page 352 -->
Paul, Minnesota, to Winnipeg, a distance of 800 kilometres, which they did successfully…<!-- page 352 -->
But the young men who delivered that torch to the stadium were turned away at the door.<!-- page 352 -->
They were not allowed in to watch those games.<!-- page 352 -->
They were not allowed to run that last 400 metres.<!-- page 352 -->
One of them told me that he remembered being turned around, [and] put back on the bus to residential school…<!-- page 352 -->
In 1999, Winnipeg hosted the Pan Am Games again and the organizers realized what had happened.<!-- page 352 -->
They tracked down the original runners, apologized, and thirty-two years later, as men in their fifties, those runners finished that 400 metres and brought the torch in…<!-- page 352 --></p>
<p>Sport is a place that we speak a universal language—a language of shared passion for moving our bodies through time and space, with strength and skill.<!-- page 352 -->
This summer [2014], Regina will host the North American Indigenous Games…<!-- page 352 -->
Let us all hope, and commit to reconcile divisiveness, racism, and stereotypes through the world of sport and support each and every young person attending those games.<!-- page 352 -->
Because they are the frontrunners of the future.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^258</a><!-- page 352 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such stories are indicative of the need for the rich history of Aboriginal peoples’ contributions to sport to become part of Canadian sport history.<!-- page 352 --></p>
<p>On November 18, 2014, we attended an event hosted by the Law Society of Upper Canada to celebrate the first time an Aboriginal community—the Mississaugas of the New Credit First Nation—was to be the Host First Nation for the Pan-Parapan American Games, held in Toronto in July and August of 2015.<!-- page 352 -->

<p>Aboriginal youth today face many barriers to leading active, healthy lives in their communities.<!-- page 353 -->
They lack opportunities to pursue excellence in sports.<!-- page 353 -->
There is little access to culturally relevant traditional sports activities that strengthen Aboriginal identity and instill a sense of pride and self-confidence.<!-- page 353 -->
Lack of resources, sports facilities, and equipment limits their ability to play sports.<!-- page 353 -->
Racism remains an issue.<!-- page 353 -->
Aboriginal girls face the extra barrier of gender discrimination.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^260</a><!-- page 353 -->
Despite the many achievements of individual Indigenous athletes, too many Aboriginal youth remain excluded from community-based sports activities and the pursuit of excellence in sport.<!-- page 353 -->
The Physical Activity and Sport Act (2003) set out the federal government’s sport policy regarding the full and fair participation of all Canadians in sport, and mandated the minister to “facilitate the participation of under-represented groups in the Canadian sport system” (S. 5.m).<!-- page 353 -->
However, the Act made no specific reference to Aboriginal peoples.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^261</a><!-- page 353 --></p>

<li>We call upon the federal government to amend the Physical Activity and Sport Act to support reconciliation by ensuring that policies to promote physical activity as a fundamental element of health and well-being, reduce barriers to sports participation, increase the pursuit of excellence in sport, and build capacity in the Canadian sport system, are inclusive of Aboriginal peoples.<!-- page 353 --></li>
</ol>
<p>In 2005, Sport Canada developed the Aboriginal Peoples’ Participation in Sports Policy, which recognized the unique circumstances of Aboriginal peoples and the role of sport as a vehicle for individual and community health and cultural revitalization.<!-- page 353 -->
It recognized that Aboriginal peoples have their own culturally diverse, traditional knowledge and cultural teachings of play, games, and sports.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^262</a><!-- page 353 -->
However, no action plan was subsequently developed to implement the policy.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^263</a><!-- page 353 -->
In 2011, in preparation for revising the 2002 Canadian Sport Policy (csp), Sport Canada conducted a series of consultations across the country, including a roundtable on “Sport and Aboriginal Peoples.”<!-- page 353 -->
The roundtable summary report noted:<!-- page 353 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Participants believe that the needs and issues of Aboriginal Peoples were not adequately reflected in the 2002 csp…<!-- page 353 -->
The feeling among the participants was that the previous policy had “no teeth.”…<!-- page 353 -->
The new csp should acknowledge the unique identity of Aboriginal Peoples, what Aboriginal Peoples can contribute to Canadian sport …<!-- page 353 -->
and make a clear commitment to action.<!-- page 353 -->
The csp can support sport for Aboriginal Peoples by reflecting Aboriginal culture and realities, cross-cultural issues between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Peoples, and an understanding of the motivation behind the interest of Aboriginal Peoples in sport…<!-- page 353 -->
If the new policy doesn’t reflect the needs and issues of Aboriginal sport, then it will not be relevant to the Aboriginal population…<!-- page 353 -->
It would be important to recognize that the barriers to sport extend beyond a lack of resources and gaps and weaknesses in the sport system.<!-- page 353 --><!-- page 354 -->
Aboriginal peoples are also affected by issues of identity and historical trauma.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^264</a><!-- page 354 -->
Despite this roundtable report based on the 2011 consultation, the Commission notes that the subsequent Canadian Sport Policy released in 2012 contains no specific references to Aboriginal peoples.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^265</a><!-- page 354 --></p>

<p>In 1977, the <em>Report of the Mackenzie Valley Pipeline Inquiry</em> recommended that a proposed natural gas pipeline down the Mackenzie Valley in the Northwest Territories not be built before Aboriginal land claims in the region were resolved and environmental concerns were addressed.<!-- page 355 -->
Justice Thomas Berger, who led the inquiry, identified the potentially devastating consequences that building a pipeline through the North would have for Dene and Inuvialuit peoples and for the fragile ecosystems.<!-- page 355 --><!-- page 356 -->
His observations, made almost forty years ago, foreshadow similar controversies and conflicts over proposed pipelines still occurring in various regions of Canada as the TRC has prepared this final report.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^269</a><!-- page 356 --></p>
<p>The political and legal landscape has shifted significantly since Justice Berger issued his report in 1977.<!-- page 356 -->
As Canada maps its economic future in regions covered by historical Treaties, modern land-claims agreements, and unceded Aboriginal title, governments and industry must now recognize that accommodating the rights of Aboriginal peoples is paramount to Canada’s long-term economic sustainability.<!-- page 356 -->
Governments aim to secure the necessary economic stability and growth to ensure prosperity for all Canadians.<!-- page 356 -->
Corporations invest time and resources in developing large-scale projects that create jobs and aim to produce profits for their shareholders.<!-- page 356 -->
Although the corporate sector is not a direct party to Treaty and land-claims agreement negotiations, industry and business play an extremely significant role in how the economic, social, and cultural aspects of reconciliation are addressed, including the extent to which opportunities and benefits are truly shared with Indigenous peoples and the environment of traditional homelands is safeguarded.<!-- page 356 --></p>
<p>The 1996 <em>Report of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples</em> noted that, historically, land and resource development activities, such as hydroelectric dams, mines, and agricultural and urban development, have had many adverse impacts on Aboriginal communities.<!-- page 356 -->
Communities were not consulted before they were relocated from their vast traditional territories to much smaller, more remote, and more crowded reserves to make way for government and industrial land and resource development projects.<!-- page 356 -->
Even when they were not relocated, Aboriginal peoples were economically marginalized in their own homelands when irreversible environmental damage was done in the name of ‘progress.’ All too often, economic development has disrupted Indigenous peoples’ cultural, spiritual, and economic ties to the land, resulting in the devastation of traditional economies and self-sufficiency, community trauma, public welfare dependency, and poor health and socio-political outcomes.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^270</a><!-- page 356 --></p>
<p>In the post-RCAP period, the Supreme Court of Canada has developed a body of law on the federal, provincial, and territorial governments’ duty to consult with Aboriginal peoples where land and resource development might infringe on their Aboriginal or Treaty rights.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^271</a><!-- page 356 -->
The court has ruled that governments can still infringe on Aboriginal rights if it can demonstrate that it is in the broader public interest to do so.<!-- page 356 -->
In the Delgamuukw case, the court described the nature of that public interest:<!-- page 356 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>[T]he development of agriculture, forestry, mining and hydroelectric power, the general economic development of the interior of British Columbia, protection of the environment or endangered species, the building of infrastructure and the settlement of foreign populations to support those aims, are the kinds of objectives that are consistent with this purpose and, in principle, can justify the infringement of aboriginal title.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^272</a><!-- page 356 --><!-- page 357 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Governments must also demonstrate that any infringement of Aboriginal rights is consistent with the Crown’s fiduciary duty towards Aboriginal peoples and upholds the honour of the Crown.<!-- page 357 -->
To meet these legal obligations, governments in all jurisdictions have developed Aboriginal consultation policies.<!-- page 357 --></p>
<p>Although the court has ruled that the duty to consult rests solely with governments, it has also said that “the Crown may delegate procedural aspects of consultation to industry proponents seeking a particular development.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^273</a><!-- page 357 -->
On a practical level, the business risks associated with legal uncertainty created by the duty to consult have motivated industry proponents to negotiate with Aboriginal communities to establish a range of mechanisms designed to ensure that Aboriginal peoples benefit directly from economic development projects in their traditional territories.<!-- page 357 -->
These may include, for example, joint venture business partnerships; impact and benefit agreements; revenue-sharing agreements; and education, training, and job opportunities.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^274</a><!-- page 357 --></p>
<p>Between 2012 and 2014, several reports highlighted the fact that Canada is once again facing significant challenges and potential opportunities related to land and resource development.<!-- page 357 -->
Economic reconciliation will require finding common ground that balances the respective rights, legal interests, and needs of Aboriginal peoples, governments, and industry in the face of climate change and competitive global markets.<!-- page 357 -->
In addition to the concrete remedial measures required, these reports also emphasized the importance of so-called soft skills—establishing trust, engaging communities, resolving conflicts, and building mutually beneficial partnerships—to advance reconciliation.<!-- page 357 --></p>
<p>In 2012, Canada’s Public Policy Forum, a non-profit organization, held a series of six regional dialogues across the country, bringing together Aboriginal leaders; senior federal, provincial, and territorial government officials; and representatives from industry, business, and financial institutions.<!-- page 357 -->
The purposes of the dialogues were to discuss issues, identify best practices, and make recommendations for action on how to ensure that Aboriginal communities benefit from large-scale resource development projects.<!-- page 357 -->
The resulting report, “Building Authentic Partnerships: Aboriginal Participation in Major Resource Development Opportunities,” identified five key opportunities for action: (1) developing authentic partnerships among Aboriginal communities, industry, governments, and academic institutions by building trust; (2) developing human capital by removing barriers to education, training, and skills development for Aboriginal entrepreneurs, workers, and leaders; (3) enhancing community control over decision making; (4) promoting entrepreneurship and business development; and (5) increasing financial participation.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^275</a><!-- page 357 -->
The report concluded:<!-- page 357 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Natural resource companies are recognizing that their operational success relies on strong, authentic community engagement.<!-- page 357 -->
Private sector initiatives have already demonstrated positive examples in areas such as revenue sharing, skills training, and business development for Aboriginal communities.<!-- page 357 --><!-- page 358 -->
Now corporations and governments need to build on these successes to keep up with the rapid pace of development, moving beyond superficial consultations toward genuine engagement.<!-- page 358 -->
Aboriginal communities must also play a leadership role to help forge these relationships, to develop local and adaptive solutions that will be essential to success.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^276</a><!-- page 358 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In November 2013, after eight months of consultations with representatives from Aboriginal communities, industry, and local and provincial governments in British Columbia and Alberta, Douglas Eyford, Canada’s special representative on west-coast energy infrastructure, issued his report to the prime minister.<!-- page 358 -->
“Forging Partnerships, Building Relationships: Aboriginal Canadians and Energy Development” focused on Aboriginal–Crown relations in the context of proposed energy infrastructure projects in British Columbia.<!-- page 358 -->
He noted that although there are many differences among Aboriginal representatives, there was general consensus that development projects must respect constitutionally protected Aboriginal rights, involve Aboriginal communities in decision making and project planning, and mitigate environmental risks.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^277</a><!-- page 358 -->
Eyford made recommendations for taking action in three key areas: building trust, fostering inclusion, and advancing reconciliation.<!-- page 358 -->
He noted in particular that “Aboriginal communities view natural resource development as linked to a broader reconciliation agenda.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^278</a><!-- page 358 -->
This is consistent with the Commission’s view that meaningful reconciliation cannot be limited to the residential school legacy, but must become the ongoing framework for resolving conflicts and building constructive partnerships with Aboriginal peoples.<!-- page 358 --></p>
<p>In December 2013, a group of current and former high-profile leaders from Aboriginal communities, business, banking, environment organizations, and federal and provincial governments released a report, “Responsible Energy Development in Canada,” summarizing the results of a year-long dialogue.<!-- page 358 -->
They concluded that Canada is facing an “energy resource development gridlock.”<!-- page 358 -->
In their view, the potential economic and social benefits derived from the exploitation of Canada’s rich natural resources must be weighed against the potential risks to Aboriginal communities and their traditional territories, and must also address broader environmental concerns associated with global warming.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^279</a><!-- page 358 -->
They emphasized that there are significant barriers to reconciliation, including conflicting values, lack of trust, and differing views on how the benefits of resource development should be distributed and adverse effects be mitigated.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^280</a><!-- page 358 -->
The report identified four principles for moving forward on responsible energy resource development: (1) forging and nurturing constructive relationships, (2) reducing cumulative social and environmental impacts, (3) ensuring the continuity of cultures and traditions, and (4) sharing the benefits fairly.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^281</a><!-- page 358 --></p>
<p>Writing about the 2014 Supreme Court of Canada decision in <em>Tsilhqot’in Nation v. British Columbia</em>, Kenneth Coates, Canada Research Chair in Regional Innovation at the University of Saskatchewan, and Dwight Newman, law professor and Canada Research Chair in Indigenous Rights in Constitutional and International Law at the University of Saskatchewan, concluded that although many challenges and barriers to reconciliation remain,<!-- page 358 --><!-- page 359 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>[w]hat the Supreme Court of Canada has highlighted at a fundamental level is that Aboriginal communities have a right to an equitable place at the table in relation to natural resource development in Canada.<!-- page 359 -->
Their empowerment through Tsilhqot’in and earlier decisions has the potential to be immensely exciting as a means of further economic development in Aboriginal communities and prosperity for all…<!-- page 359 -->
[T]he time is now for governments, Aboriginal communities, and resource sector companies to work together to build partnerships for the future…<!-- page 359 -->
We need to keep building a national consensus that responsible resource development that takes account of sustainability issues and that respects Indigenous communities, contributes positively—very positively—to Canada and its future.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^282</a><!-- page 359 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Internationally, there is a growing awareness in the corporate sector that the <em>United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples</em> is an effective framework for industry and business to establish respectful relationships and work collaboratively with Indigenous peoples.<!-- page 359 -->
In 2013, the United Nations Global Compact published a business guide that sets out practical actions that corporations and businesses can undertake in compliance with the <em>Declaration</em>.<!-- page 359 -->
It notes:<!-- page 359 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Business faces both challenges and opportunities when engaging with indigenous peoples.<!-- page 359 -->
When businesses collaborate with indigenous peoples, they are often able to achieve sustainable economic growth, for example, by optimizing ecosystem services and harnessing local or traditional knowledge.<!-- page 359 -->
Positive engagement with indigenous peoples can also contribute to the success of resource development initiatives—from granting and maintaining social licenses to actively participating in business ventures as owners, contractors and employees.<!-- page 359 -->
Failing to respect the rights of indigenous peoples can put businesses at significant legal, financial and reputational risk…<!-- page 359 -->
Continuing dialogue between business and indigenous peoples can potentially strengthen indigenous peoples’ confidence in partnering with business and building healthy relationships.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^283</a><!-- page 359 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the Commission’s view, sustainable reconciliation on the land involves realizing the economic potential of Indigenous communities in a fair, just, and equitable manner that respects their right to self-determination.<!-- page 359 -->
Economic reconciliation involves working in partnership with Indigenous peoples to ensure that lands and resources within their traditional territories are developed in culturally respectful ways that fully recognize Treaty and Aboriginal rights and title.<!-- page 359 --></p>
<p>Establishing constructive, mutually beneficial relationships and partnerships with Indigenous communities will contribute to their economic growth, improve community health and well-being, and ensure environmental sustainability that will ultimately benefit Indigenous peoples and all Canadians.<!-- page 359 -->
Unlike with the residential schools of the past, where Aboriginal peoples had no say in the design of the system and no ability to protect their children from intrinsic harms, First Nations, Inuit, and Métis peoples today want to manage their own lives.<!-- page 359 --><!-- page 360 -->
In terms of the economy, that means participating in it on their own terms.<!-- page 360 -->
They want to be part of the decision-making process.<!-- page 360 -->
They want their communities to benefit if large-scale economic projects come into their territories.<!-- page 360 -->
They want to establish and develop their own businesses in ways that are compatible with their identity, cultural values, and world views as Indigenous peoples.<!-- page 360 -->
They want opportunities to work for companies that are proactively addressing systemic racism and inequity.<!-- page 360 -->
Corporations can demonstrate leadership by using the <em>United Nations Declaration</em> as a reconciliation framework.<!-- page 360 --></p>

<p>We call upon the corporate sector in Canada to adopt the <em>United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples</em> as a reconciliation framework and to apply its principles, norms, and standards to corporate policy and core operational activities involving Indigenous peoples and their lands and resources.<!-- page 360 -->
This would include, but not be limited to, the following:<!-- page 360 --></p>

<li>
<p>Provide education for management and staff on the history of Aboriginal peoples, including the history and legacy of residential schools, the <em>United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples</em>, Treaties and Aboriginal rights, Indigenous law, and Aboriginal–Crown relations.

<p>The Commission believes that reconciliation cannot be left up to governments, the courts, and churches alone.<!-- page 360 -->
There must also be dialogue and action in communities across the country.<!-- page 360 -->
Reconciliation must happen across all sectors of Canadian society.<!-- page 360 -->
Canadians still have much to learn from each other.<!-- page 360 -->
Past generations of newcomers faced injustices and prejudice similar to those experienced by residential school students and their families.<!-- page 360 --><!-- page 361 -->
More recent immigrants have struggled with racism and misconceptions as they come to take their place in the Canadian nation.<!-- page 361 --></p>
<p>Despite the many barriers to reconciliation, this Commission remains cautiously optimistic.<!-- page 361 -->
At the Alberta National Event in March 2014, TRC Honorary Witness Wab Kinew spoke about the changes that are already happening across this land that give rise to hope.<!-- page 361 -->
He began by explaining that all day he had been carrying with him<!-- page 361 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>a ceremonial pipe, a sacred pipe, which when you bind the two sides together—the stem and the bowl—it offers us a model of reconciliation, of two forces coming together to be more powerful than they were otherwise.<!-- page 361 -->
So it’s important for me to come up here before you all and to speak Anishnaabemowin, and a little bit of Lakota, and to carry a pipe because it sends a message.<!-- page 361 -->
It sends a message to those who designed the residential school system, that you have failed.<!-- page 361 -->
We were abused.<!-- page 361 -->
Our languages were assaulted.<!-- page 361 -->
Our families were harmed, in some cases, irreparably.<!-- page 361 -->
But we are still here.<!-- page 361 -->
We are still here.<!-- page 361 -->
So in honour of my late father, Tobasonakwut, a Survivor of St.<!-- page 361 -->
Mary’s residential school in Rat Portage, Ontario, I wanted to say that.<!-- page 361 -->
I so wish that he could have seen this—the final event of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission—so that he could see how this country has changed.<!-- page 361 -->
How when he was a child, he was told that he was a savage.<!-- page 361 -->
He was told that he was nothing.<!-- page 361 -->
He was assaulted, taken away from his family, taken away from his father’s trapline.<!-- page 361 -->
To see the change that has happened, where today in Canada, there are tens of thousands of people from all walks of life gathering together to set that right and to stand up for justice for Indigenous peoples.<!-- page 361 --></p>
<p>The world has changed in another way as well; the old dichotomy of white people versus Indians no longer applies.<!-- page 361 -->
Look around at Canada today.<!-- page 361 -->
There are the descendants of Europeans.<!-- page 361 -->
There are the descendents of Indigenous peoples.<!-- page 361 -->
But there are also the descendants of Arab nations, of Iran, of the Slavic nations, of Africa, of the Caribbean, Southeast Asian, Chinese, and Japanese peoples.<!-- page 361 -->
The challenge of reconciliation may have begun between Indigenous peoples and Europeans, but now the project of reconciliation will be undertaken by the children of all those nations that I just mentioned.<!-- page 361 -->
And though the world has changed, and Canada has changed, we still have a long way to go…<!-- page 361 -->
We are all in this together.<!-- page 361 -->
Let us commit to removing the political, economic, and social barriers that prevent the full realization of that vision [of reconciliation] on these lands.<!-- page 361 -->
Let us raise up the residential school Survivors, and their example of courage, grace, and compassion, in whose footsteps we walk towards that brighter day.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^284</a><!-- page 361 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the community level, where contact between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal peoples is often minimal or marred by distrust and racism, establishing respectful relationships involves learning to be good neighbours.<!-- page 361 -->
This means being respectful—listening to, and learning from, each other; building understanding; and taking concrete action to improve relationships.<!-- page 361 -->
At the Victoria Regional Event, intergenerational Survivor Victoria Wells said,<!-- page 361 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’ll know that reconciliation is happening in Canadian society when Canadians, wherever they live, are able to say the names of the tribes with which they’re neighbours; they’re able to pronounce names from the community, or of people that they know, and they’re able to say hello, goodbye, in the language of their neighbours…<!-- page 362 -->
That will show me manners.<!-- page 362 -->
That will show me that they’ve invested in finding out the language of the land [on] which they live …<!-- page 362 -->
because the language comes from the land …<!-- page 362 -->
the language is very organic to where it comes from and the invitation to you is to learn that and to be enlightened by that and to be informed by [our] ways of thinking and knowing and seeing and understanding.<!-- page 362 -->
So that, to me, is reconciliation.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^285</a><!-- page 362 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Former public school teacher Lynne Phillips cautioned that establishing trust will be one of the major challenges of the reconciliation process.<!-- page 362 -->
She said,<!-- page 362 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I really understand the reticence of some First Nations people about wanting to accept offers of friendship and possibilities of interaction.<!-- page 362 -->
I understand why that is and I hope that in time we will be able to gain trust and some kind ways of interacting with one another that will be mutually beneficial…<!-- page 362 -->
I think we’re moving…<!-- page 362 -->
I think civil society, non-governmental organizations, church organizations, Aboriginal organizations are moving in the direction of openness …<!-- page 362 -->
and I think we have a long ways to go.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^286</a><!-- page 362 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In July of 2013, at the Community Hearing in Maskwacis (formerly Hobbema, Alberta), at the former site of Ermineskin residential school, Professor Roger Epp said that over the years, his Cree students helped him to understand<!-- page 362 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>what it was that a fourth-generation grandson of settler people needed to know in order to live here …<!-- page 362 -->
with a sense of memory and care and obligation.<!-- page 362 -->
For I too have ancestors buried on Treaty 6 land…<!-- page 362 -->
I learned from a student from Hobbema that we’re all Treaty people here…<!-- page 362 -->
A Treaty is a relationship after all and we live here on the basis of an agreement signed in 1876, 1877; the first time, not very far from where my settler ancestors homesteaded…<!-- page 362 -->
While it is good for national leaders to make public apologies, the work of reconciliation is not just for governments.<!-- page 362 -->
Actually, I don’t think they’re very good at it.<!-- page 362 -->
The work of reconciliation is work for neighbours…<!-- page 362 -->
I think the words [of the apology] were sincere, but they were not enough.<!-- page 362 -->
They did not change relationships, not enough.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^287</a><!-- page 362 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We also heard that day from Mayor Bill Elliot, from the nearby city of Wetaskiwin.<!-- page 362 -->
He explained that prior to the TRC’s Community Hearing, he, along with Grade Ten students and others from Hobbema and Wetaskiwin, had attended a workshop with Survivors.<!-- page 362 -->
Listening to their residential school experiences helped those who attended to begin to understand how deeply the residential schools had scarred Survivors, their families, and the whole community.<!-- page 362 -->
He said,<!-- page 362 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think it helped the people of Wetaskawin come to an understanding of some of the trials and tribulations that our neighbours to the south have been going through all their lives…<!-- page 362 --><!-- page 363 -->
We are working on a healing journey between the City of Wetaskiwin and the Cree First Nations…<!-- page 363 -->
As you come into Wetaskiwin from the south, you will see that our [city] sign is in Cree syllabics as well—that welcomes you…<!-- page 363 -->
We still have a long way to go.<!-- page 363 -->
We are taking baby steps in the healing process.<!-- page 363 -->
But we are working together for better communities, to understand and respect the differences and similarities in our cultures.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^288</a><!-- page 363 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the Alberta National Event in 2014, Mayor Elliot, who was also inducted as a TRC Honorary Witness, offered an expression of reconciliation:<!-- page 363 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our community is trying to learn more about the Survivors and the residential schools.<!-- page 363 -->
Our schools, churches, and community have made cupcakes and birthday cards for the big birthday party tomorrow.<!-- page 363 -->
Members of our community have been here for the last two days…<!-- page 363 -->
They are very, very supportive and they want to learn.<!-- page 363 -->
We are trying to learn more about and understand the effects of residential schools and our friends from Maskwacis because we want to be good neighbours.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^289</a><!-- page 363 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The cities of Vancouver, Toronto, Edmonton, and Calgary have also issued proclamations declaring a year of reconciliation.<!-- page 363 -->
In 2014, Vancouver went a step further, declaring that it was now a “City of Reconciliation,” and it has established a long-term framework for partnership and relationship building with the Musqueam, Squamish, and TsleilWaututh nations and urban Aboriginal people.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^290</a><!-- page 363 -->
At the British Columbia National Event, TRC Honorary Witness Mayor Gregor Robertson said,<!-- page 363 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are blessed to have so many different cultures in this place, and all of us who come from afar …<!-- page 363 -->
have been incredibly lucky to be able to come to this place.<!-- page 363 -->
Many of us come from families, from clans, from cultures, that were wiped out, that had to leave.<!-- page 363 -->
We were forced off our territories, and somehow we’ve managed to make a home here.<!-- page 363 -->
That’s largely because of those First Nations ancestors who welcomed us …<!-- page 363 -->
who made it possible for refugees, for people of broken cultures all over the world to settle here, to stay here, even though our predecessors and our ancestors turned it right around and terrible things have happened.<!-- page 363 -->
I think the strength that is in Aboriginal peoples across Canada is something for the world to learn from, something that we can apply to the big decisions that we have to make in our governments, our communities, our cities.<!-- page 363 --></p>
<p>When I hear the strength in Survivors, when I hear the phrase “brave children,” when I think about brave Elders, I think “brave culture”—that bravery and that determination to learn from this past and to make the best decisions about how we look after each other, how we take care of each other, and those that need that help the most…<!-- page 363 -->
That we lift each other up; that we take care of the land and the sea that we inherited for the generations to come.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^291</a><!-- page 363 --></p>

<p>At the British Columbia National Event, the Commission, in partnership with the Inspirit Foundation, hosted a Youth Panel, “Be the Change: Young People Healing the Past and Building the Future.”<!-- page 364 -->
In this cross-cultural dialogue, youth leaders described the intergenerational impacts of human rights violations such as the residential schools, the Holocaust, Canada’s internment of Japanese Canadians during World War Two, and the head tax imposed on Chinese immigrants to Canada.<!-- page 364 -->
They spoke about community and about turning reconciliation into action.<!-- page 364 -->
Tsilhqot’in intergenerational Survivor Kim Harvey said,<!-- page 364 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I encountered many uncomfortable moments trying to explain what happened to my people and why there is so much alcoholism and drug abuse.<!-- page 364 -->
There is so much focus on all the negative things…<!-- page 364 -->
No one talked about the residential schools…<!-- page 364 -->
There are so many horrible stereotypes that our young people face every day.<!-- page 364 -->
I struggle with issues of family, identity, and community every day…<!-- page 364 -->
Reconciliation to me comes down to truth, education, and knowledge sharing practices…<!-- page 364 -->
Reconciliation is about relationship.<!-- page 364 -->
To reconcile, I really need to understand what happened to you, who you are, and what, as a community member, I can do to make our community better…<!-- page 364 --></p>
<p>Reconciliation is a shared experience…<!-- page 364 -->
The residential schools were done [to us] by an outside party …<!-- page 364 -->
when people ask “why don’t you just get over it?”<!-- page 364 -->
I find that frustrating because it takes the onus off the shared relationship [as if ] somehow this entire country is not involved in the reconciliation process…<!-- page 364 -->
That, to me, is a disservice to this nation in terms of reconciliation…<!-- page 364 -->
It’s everyone’s responsibility to educate themselves about what happened…<!-- page 364 -->
With relationship comes respect…<!-- page 364 -->
What helps young people, Indigenous or not, is to find your role, have adult allies to help you find that role, fulfill your responsibilities within that role, and then be of service to the community…<!-- page 364 -->
If we all did that …<!-- page 364 -->
to me that would be reconciliation in action…<!-- page 364 -->
It’s about finding out about your neighbour.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^292</a><!-- page 364 --></p>

<p>Kevin Takahide Lee, an intergenerational Survivor of the internment of Japanese Canadians during the Second World War, said,<!-- page 364 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I acknowledge that we are on Coast Salish lands.<!-- page 364 -->
It was also on these very lands here at the PNE [Pacific National Exhibition fairgrounds] that my family was held during the war before being sent to the internment camp.<!-- page 364 -->
It is my parents and grandparents who are Survivors…<!-- page 364 -->
[They] never talked about what happened in the internment camps …<!-- page 364 -->
even after the Japanese-Canadian redress happened …<!-- page 364 -->
hearing these stories from our Elders is very rare…<!-- page 364 -->
When I was four or five, I came here to the PNE as most families do…<!-- page 364 -->
When it came to going inside the barn here, just two doors away, my grandmother would not come in.<!-- page 364 -->
That’s because that livestock building was used to hold her and other women and children, during the war, for months…<!-- page 364 -->
When I was a child, I couldn’t comprehend this, but as an adult, I understand…<!-- page 364 -->
This is what it means to me, as an intergenerational Survivor.<!-- page 364 --><!-- page 365 -->
People who I love and admire were wronged, humiliated, and forgotten, and unjustly imprisoned by the country I …<!-- page 365 -->
call home…<!-- page 365 -->
[The part of the Japanese redress program that worked best] was the investment in communities and culture …<!-- page 365 -->
[and the establishment of ] the Canadian Race Relations Foundation …<!-- page 365 -->
to ensure that this never happened again…<!-- page 365 -->
Only when “you” and “me” become “us” and “we” can there be any reconciliation.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^293</a><!-- page 365 --></p>

<p>Caroline Wong said that as an intergenerational Survivor of the Chinese head tax, which her grandfathers had to pay when they entered Canada from China,<!-- page 365 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I grew up rejecting the stereotypical [identity] of the Chinese person because I wanted to be as ‘white’ as possible…<!-- page 365 -->
In terms of reconciliation, my grandmother is a warrior …<!-- page 365 -->
she’s been fighting for head tax redress.<!-- page 365 -->
In 2006, the federal government offered an apology and compensation for head tax survivors and their spouses, but very few were still living.<!-- page 365 -->
It was a huge slap in the face for many Survivors like my grandmother and other first-generation Chinese Canadians who suffered the impacts of discrimination…<!-- page 365 -->
What is the price you can put on loss of life, loss of land, loss of family, and discrimination and abuse.<!-- page 365 -->
You can’t put a price on these things…<!-- page 365 -->
Compensation is only part of the answer…<!-- page 365 -->
Reconciliation is not just an apology but a two-way path of apology and forgiveness…<!-- page 365 -->
Education …<!-- page 365 -->
exposing the truth of what happened and making sure it’s never forgotten…<!-- page 365 -->
Reconciliation starts with youth and building intercultural understanding…I hope this is the start of many other intercultural dialogues…<!-- page 365 -->
We need to understand about residential schools and also what other cultural groups have experienced.<!-- page 365 -->
I challenge all of you to ask, “What does it mean to be Canadian?”<!-- page 365 -->
Or, if you’re from another place, “What is your role in this community?”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^294</a><!-- page 365 --></p>

<p>Danny Richmond, an intergenerational Holocaust Survivor, said,<!-- page 365 --></p>

<p>My grandmother and grandfather lived through things in their twenties that I can’t even begin to imagine …<!-- page 365 -->
for my people, this history is still an open wound …<!-- page 365 -->
what can I tell you that will give you understanding of this?<!-- page 365 -->
…<!-- page 365 -->
It’s always been part of my life…<!-- page 365 -->
Because the Holocaust was at such a widespread global level …<!-- page 365 -->
who is the perpetrator?<!-- page 365 -->
Every day, people were implicated …<!-- page 365 -->
and there were systems and nations involved …<!-- page 365 -->
so there’s no one person I can accept an apology from.<!-- page 365 -->
The German government has apologized.<!-- page 365 -->
It’s about the reconciliation of trust in humanity that this kind of persecution won’t happen again to the Jews or globally…<!-- page 365 -->
Reconciliation is about making sure that none of our communities suffer that persecution again …<!-- page 365 -->
for me it’s about guarding our institutions to make sure they aren’t continuing this kind of persecution …<!-- page 365 -->
we’ve had the apology from the government but how are we checking in to see how we’re doing today?<!-- page 365 -->
…<!-- page 365 -->
We need to create a National Day of Reconciliation that deals with these past human rights abuses, and educates [people] about what [what happens when we] dehumanize people.<!-- page 365 -->
Canada was a safe haven for my family but it’s also a nation with a lot of pain and warts in its background.<!-- page 365 --><!-- page 366 -->

<p>For new Canadians, many of whom carry their own traumatic memories of colonial violence, racism, and oppression, finding common ground as Treaty people involves learning about the history of Aboriginal peoples and finding ways to build stronger relationships of solidarity with them.<!-- page 366 -->
The Commission believes there is an urgent need for more dialogue between Aboriginal peoples and new Canadians.<!-- page 366 -->
At a forum, “From Remembrance to Reconciliation,” co-sponsored by the Ontario Human Rights Commission, Colour of Poverty, Colour of Change, and the Metro Toronto Chinese and South-East Asian Legal Clinic, and attended by the TRC Commissioners, participants reflected on how their own histories shaped their understanding of violence, oppression, and racism, the stereotypes they learned about Aboriginal peoples in Canada, and the challenges and opportunities of building alliances together.<!-- page 366 --></p>
<p>Akua Benjamin, who came from the Caribbean, with its history of slavery, said,<!-- page 366 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>How is it that our histories …<!-- page 366 -->

<p>I came [to Canada] from India thirty years ago…<!-- page 366 -->
One of the things that became apparent to me right away was that I came [here] with my own baggage of stereotypes [of Aboriginal peoples].<!-- page 366 -->
These were defined by what I had seen in Hollywood films and comic books…<!-- page 366 -->
I spent a lot of time in Toronto going to soup kitchens, hanging out with people, trying to understand what the current reality is of First Nations people in an urban centre like Toronto.<!-- page 366 -->

How do I fit into this landscape?<!-- page 366 --></p>
<p>Many Canadians feel that Canadian identity and cultural identity is somehow defined by this universal humanism.<!-- page 366 -->
On the flip side, we have Prime Minister Harper who says Canada has no history of colonialism.<!-- page 366 -->
They do the same thing.<!-- page 366 -->

Twenty years ago, I became a Canadian citizen and one of the things that wasn’t made clear to me …<!-- page 367 -->
was that when we took that oath [of allegiance] we would become party to the Treaties that were signed…<!-- page 367 -->

<p>In preparing to become Canadian citizens, all immigrants to Canada study a booklet called <em>Discover Canada</em>.<!-- page 367 -->
It explains, “To understand what it means to be Canadian, it is important to know about our three founding peoples—<strong>Aboriginal</strong>, <strong>French</strong> and <strong>British</strong>.”<!-- page 367 -->
It says the following about Aboriginal peoples:<!-- page 367 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The ancestors of Aboriginal peoples are believed to have migrated from Asia many thousands of years ago.<!-- page 367 -->
They were well established here long before explorers from Europe first came to North America.<!-- page 367 -->
Diverse, vibrant First Nations cultures were rooted in religious beliefs about their relationship to the Creator, the natural environment and each other.<!-- page 367 -->
Aboriginal and treaty rights are in the Canadian Constitution.<!-- page 367 -->
Territorial rights were first guaranteed through the Royal Proclamation of 1763 by King George III, and established the basis for negotiating treaties with the newcomers—treaties that were not always fully respected.<!-- page 367 -->
From the 1800s until the 1980s, the federal government placed many Aboriginal children in residential schools to educate and assimilate them into mainstream Canadian culture.<!-- page 367 -->
The schools were poorly funded and inflicted hardship on the students; some were physically abused.<!-- page 367 -->
Aboriginal languages and cultural practices were mostly prohibited.<!-- page 367 -->
In 2008, Ottawa formally apologized to the former students.<!-- page 367 -->
In today’s Canada, Aboriginal peoples enjoy renewed pride and confidence, and have made significant achievements in agriculture, the environment, business and the arts.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^299</a><!-- page 367 --></p>

<p>The guide explains the rights and responsibilities of citizenship.<!-- page 368 -->
In describing Canada’s legal system, it states,<!-- page 368 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Canadian law has several sources, including laws passed by Parliament and the provincial legislatures, English common law, the civil code of France and the unwritten constitution that we have inherited from Great Britain.<!-- page 368 -->
Together, these secure for Canadians an 800-year-old tradition of ordered liberty, which dates back to the signing of the Magna Carta in 1215 in England.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^300</a><!-- page 368 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Discover Canada</em> ignores Indigenous peoples as being a source of law for Canada, and says that Canada’s tradition of an “ordered liberty” is due to England, and not at all to Canada’s Aboriginal peoples, who welcomed the European explorers, helped them survive in this climate, guided them throughout the country, and entered into Treaties with them to share their land with the newcomers from Europe.<!-- page 368 --></p>

<p>The guide includes the Oath of Citizenship to the Queen that all new citizens must currently pledge: “In Canada, we profess our loyalty to a person who represents all Canadians and not to a document such as a constitution, a banner such as a flag, or a geopolitical entity such as a country.”<!-- page 368 -->
The current oath requires new Canadians to pledge as follows: “I swear (or affirm) that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, Queen of Canada, Her Heirs and Successors, and that I will faithfully observe the laws of Canada and fulfill my duties as a Canadian citizen.”<!-- page 368 --></p>
<p>Precisely because “we are all Treaty people,” Canada’s Oath of Citizenship must include a solemn promise to respect Aboriginal and Treaty rights.<!-- page 368 --></p>

<li>
<p>We call upon the federal government, in collaboration with the national Aboriginal organizations, to revise the information kit for newcomers to Canada and its citizenship test to reflect a more inclusive history of the diverse Aboriginal peoples of Canada, including information about the Treaties and the history of residential schools.<!-- page 368 --></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We call upon the Government of Canada to replace the Oath of Citizenship with the following:<!-- page 368 --></p>

<blockquote>
<p>I swear (or affirm) that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, Queen of Canada, Her Heirs and Successors, and that I will faithfully observe the laws of Canada including Treaties with Indigenous Peoples, and fulfill my duties as a Canadian citizen.<!-- page 368 --></p>

<p>On September 22, 2013, the day after the British Columbia National Event, the Commissioners joined 70,000 people gathered in the pouring rain to participate in a Walk for Reconciliation, organized by Reconciliation Canada, a non-profit organization.<!-- page 369 -->
If one was looking down Georgia Street in downtown Vancouver, a sea of multicoloured umbrellas was visible as far as the eye could see.<!-- page 369 -->
Traditional ceremonies and protocols began the walk.<!-- page 369 -->
Chiefs in regalia, women wrapped in button blankets and cedar capes, and drumming, dancing, and singing accompanied Survivors, their families, and people from multiple faith traditions and all walks of life, who marched together in solidarity.<!-- page 369 -->
We walked for Survivors and all that they have done to bring the long-hidden story of residential schools to the country’s attention.<!-- page 369 -->
We walked to remember the thousands of children who died in residential schools.<!-- page 369 -->
We walked to honour all Indigenous peoples as they reclaim and restore their identity, equality, and dignity.<!-- page 369 -->
We walked to stand up for the transformative social change that is so urgently needed in Canada.<!-- page 369 -->
And, we walked for the uplifting solidarity of being united with tens of thousands of others, all joined together in a new community of common purpose.<!-- page 369 -->
Residential school Survivor and Gwawaenuk Elder Chief Dr.<!-- page 369 -->
Robert Joseph, speaking as Reconciliation Canada’s ambassador, has said, “Reconciliation includes anyone with an open heart and an open mind, who is willing to look to the future in a new way.<!-- page 369 -->
Let us find a way to belong to this time and place together.<!-- page 369 -->
Our future, and the well-being of all our children, rests with the kind of relationships we build today.”<a href="footnote-placeholder">^301</a><!-- page 369 --></p>
<p>In November 2012, Elders from Indigenous nations and many other cultures gathered for two days in Musqueam territory in Vancouver, British Columbia, to talk about how reconciliation can help Canada move forward.<!-- page 369 -->
In a statement afterwards, they said,<!-- page 369 --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>As Canadians, we share a responsibility to look after each other and acknowledge the pain and suffering that our diverse societies have endured—a pain that has been handed down to the next generations.<!-- page 369 -->
We need to right those wrongs, heal together, and create a new future that honours the unique gifts of our children and grandchildren.<!-- page 369 --></p>
<p>How do we do this?<!-- page 369 -->
Through sharing our personal stories, legends and traditional teachings, we found that we are interconnected through the same mind and spirit.<!-- page 369 -->
Our traditional teachings speak to acts such as holding one another up, walking together, balance, healing and unity.<!-- page 369 -->
Our stories show how these teachings can heal their pain and restore dignity.<!-- page 369 -->
We discovered that in all of our cultural traditions, there are teachings about reconciliation, forgiveness, unity, healing and balance.<!-- page 369 --></p>
<p>We invite you to search in your own traditions and beliefs, and those of your ancestors, to find these core values that create a peaceful harmonious society and a healthy earth.<a href="footnote-placeholder">^302</a><!-- page 369 --></p>

<p>The work of the TRC has shown just how difficult the process of truth determination has been.<!-- page 370 -->
Thousands of Survivors came forward and, in tears and with anger, shared their pain.<!-- page 370 -->
They showed how humour, perseverance, and resilience got them through the hardest of times, and how life after the schools sometimes just got too hard.<!-- page 370 -->
They came forward to share their stories, not just to ease their burden, but also to try to make things better for their children and their grandchildren.<!-- page 370 --></p>
<p>Reconciliation is going to take hard work.<!-- page 370 -->
People of all walks of life and at all levels of society will need to be willingly engaged.<!-- page 370 --></p>
<p>Reconciliation calls for personal action.<!-- page 370 -->
People need to get to know each other.<!-- page 370 -->
They need to learn how to speak to, and about, each other respectfully.<!-- page 370 -->
They need to learn how to speak knowledgeably about the history of this country.<!-- page 370 -->
And they need to ensure that their children learn how to do so as well.<!-- page 370 --></p>
<p>Reconciliation calls for group action.<!-- page 370 -->
The 2012 Vancouver Olympics Organizing Committee recognized, paid tribute to, and honoured the Four Host First Nations at all public events it organized.<!-- page 370 -->
Clubs, sports teams, artists, musicians, writers, teachers, doctors, lawyers, judges, and politicians need to learn from that example of how to be more inclusive and more respectful, and how to engage more fully in the dialogue about reconciliation.<!-- page 370 --></p>
<p>Reconciliation calls for community action.<!-- page 370 -->
The City of Vancouver, British Columbia, proclaimed itself the City of Reconciliation.<!-- page 370 -->
The City of Halifax, Nova Scotia, holds an annual parade and procession commemorating the 1761 Treaty of Peace and Friendship.<!-- page 370 -->
Speeches are delivered and everyone who attends is feasted.<!-- page 370 -->
The City of Wetaskiwin, Alberta, erected a sign at its outskirts with the city’s name written in Cree syllabics.<!-- page 370 -->
Other communities can do similar things.<!-- page 370 --></p>
<p>Reconciliation calls for federal, provincial, and territorial government action.<!-- page 370 --></p>
<p>Reconciliation calls for national action.<!-- page 370 --></p>
<p>The way we govern ourselves must change.<!-- page 370 --></p>
<p>Laws must change.<!-- page 370 --></p>
<p>Policies and programs must change.<!-- page 370 --></p>
<p>The way we educate our children and ourselves must change.<!-- page 370 --></p>
